I have just planted it myself, just when I was about to graduate from Africa Bible College. I did my Bachelor’s degree there in biblical studies.<br><br>It’s when I was attending Pastor Brian Biedebach’s class [in my Advanced Diploma] that I decided to take the challenge of planting a church, because I discovered that in the area, there is not many people who are exposing the word of God, yeah.<br><br>I saw a need in Chizapo, so that is why I decided to plant the church so that should reach to the people, and also be able to expose the word of God to the people.",Was that your first time being a pastor? How did you first decide you wanted to become a pastor?,"Yeah, since 2004 up to 2011, I was in Mzuzu. Yes, I was pastoring a church, but before that I had no Bible training. So, it was very hard to pastor a church without a Bible trainer.<br><br>Well, I… I would say, God just gave me a desire, because I received Jesus Christ when I was at Sunday school, and when I received Jesus Christ as my Savior, I had a desire to preach the Good News, and that desire started growing, yeah.<br><br><i>How old were you when you decided you wanted to be a pastor?</i><br><br>I would say I was around 17.",What are some challenges you have faced in ministry?,"The first challenge that I faced… I would say a lack of training, yes. It was a very big challenge because it was hard for me to prepare a sermon, yeah. It’s hard, you have a passion, but to prepare a sermon was very hard, and how to go to church, and how to find it hard to expose the word of God to the people whom I love.<br><br>Yeah, so that was like… breaking my heart, yeah. Really. And the other thing, here in Malawi, lack of financial support. Because we have a lot of people who have the passion to share the word of God, but they have limited resources. So I would say, yeah, resources, yes.",Do you have any future ministry plans?,"At the moment, I have dedicated my life to planting the church, and also to see that church grow. I’m also involved in other ministries—IBF Church [where Brian Biedebach, Jim Ayres, and Gideon Manda attend and serve] has also a children’s ministry in Chizapo. So I do go there on Thursdays to help teaching the kids, yeah.",How did you first come to believe that Jesus died for your sins?,"I first came to believe that Jesus died for my sins when I was at secondary school. There was an organization by the name, [Student Christian] Organization of Malawi, and they used to meet at school and they were also zealous to share their faith and some of the guys kept on coming to me to share the word of God. They used to tell me that Jesus died for me—not only me, but the whole world. And at first, [<i>smiling</i>] it didn’t make any sense, until one day that I was convinced in my heart that surely Jesus died for my sins. And that day, I made a decision to surrender my life to Christ.",How did you see your life change after [becoming a Christian]?,"Yeah… on that very same day that I received Jesus Christ, I realized that Jesus really died for my sins. I had peace in my heart, and I had assurance within me that if I die today, [<i>smiling</i>] I am going to heaven. Yeah, I have met a lot of things, trials… but God has been seeing me through those trials.",What are some ways we can be praying for you?,"1) Well… [<i>laughs</i>] That’s good, because, as I told you that I’m planting a church—I would say I’ve already planted it, and it is still small—at the moment 10 [people]—and… it’s not easy. It’s hard, but it is possible, by the grace of God, yeah. So, you can assist me praying for the church that I am planting, that I remain focused, yeah.<br><br>2) And, you can also praying for some people who can stand with me and giving me advice, yeah. Because at the moment, I would say… there is one pastor who is standing with me. I meet with him almost every month, yeah. But now he is out of the country—he is Pastor Matt [Floreen, a missionary pastor at IBF Church]. Yeah, so… you can also be praying for him, that he would continue standing with me. Yes, helping me as he’s doing at the moment, yes.",What is your favorite thing about Malawi?,"The favorite thing about Malawi… [<i>laughs</i>] Peace! I like the peace that we have in Malawi.

Before I converted to be a Christian, I was really lost because I would be involved in excessive beer drinking, smoke marijuana.<br><br>But one day I found a crowd of people on the ground. I thought there was a football [game], then I realized someone was speaking. Then I went there for a very short time of period I listened to the message and he was preaching from the book of Hebrews, chapter 9 verse 27—the very same message attached to my heart.<br><br>There I was convicted, decided to repent, and after repenting I confessed my sins I accepted Jesus to be Lord and my Savior. Yeah, that was 1996. Then, I thought of myself going to church. After going to church, I started growing up spiritually; later in 2000, that was the very first time that the call of being a pastor raised in my heart. Then, this is how I am, and now I am a pastor.<br><br>Actually, before coming to CAPA, I planted a church [in Lilongwe, Area 24] that I am ministering at right now. It’s a small church, that’s got 30 members.",What are some of the challenges you have faced in ministry? What do you think God has taught you through the challenges?,"The very same challenges I have faced are that sometimes, I meet people that are… they are at a higher class than me. So when I… I speak to them on the message, they look at me the way I am. They come up to balancing between them and me. So they see like to me, it’s nothing. <br><br>Sometimes when we meet people who are wealthy, they can’t easily be convinced to the message that I preach—and the other things like… to support myself, then to minister at the very same time, becomes a very big challenge.<br><br>Yeah… the very encouraging word for me is from the book of Joshua, chapter 24, verses 24: Choose whom to serve—so despite whatever, I choose to serve the Lord. The verse is speaking about when Joshua was speaking to the Israels: “But for me and my family, we will serve the Lord.” So for me, whether I am in whatsoever circumstances, I have chosen, and I have dedicated my life, despite whatever, to serve the Lord.",Do you have any future ministry plans?,"Yes, I have future ministry plans for me. Like for me, I also have the passion for a children’s ministry. Because I see what I am learning here at CAPA—if I cannot impart these thing even to the children, to the youth, then, there is no generation changing coming. Unless we bring what we are learning, and imparting the youth—then! Will bring the change.<br><br> Otherwise here in Malawi, youth, they are not so committed to serving Christ, because of the, the world changing system itself. Because of the western development that is coming, so… youth children are involved in things like pornography, and the worldly things.<br><br><i>In Malawi?</i><br><br>In Malawi! So, my heart is so passioned for the youth. So, I’m really willing to… I’ve already developed the ministry…in my church. We have children that we meet every Saturdays, and eh, I also meet with the youths every Wednesdays. And, I am also trying to, ah… to equip, or to develop, into young leaders. And really, if God-willing, upon my heart, I’d like to develop probably, seventy, young, powerful leadership, before I die.<br><br><i>What are you doing for the children's and youth ministry right now?</i><br><br>Well, my wife is there teaching—ah, is volunteer teaching them. I am there for the spiritual things, teaching the Bible, trying to help them reciting the verses, so my wife is taking like the academic– for me, spiritual things.<br><br>Like when they are back from the government schools, so they are coming, at the church two days per week, whereby my wife is the trying to teach some readings and writings. So, this is my passion that it would come in time whereby I can help those writing materials, school uniforms, providing school fees… this is what I am looking for so that they can see the church… is helping, or supporting them.",What are some ways we can be praying for you?,"1) One, being a pastor who desires to be a full [time] minister.

So, so the planted church is very hard for me, to get support from within the church. <br><br>2)My heart is to take my full time to the church, and at the same time, I am looking to support my family. So these two things, because of planting the church and nothing else that I can get the support, I have no other profession apart from being, saying, I am called to be a pastor. So no any profession that can support my… support me financially. So this is a very big challenge that I’ve experienced through the years that I’ve been a minister as a pastor, since 2010, sure.<br><br>3)Right now, if I can be helped with some, let’s say the team, that is involved in children’s ministry.

Like we say, dialoguing. People who like peace. So, it’s a peaceful country. I like to be a pastor, not just because it’s peaceful, but because I like to pastor in Malawi because… [<i>pause</i>] I was a person who was lost, and some people understand my… bad things that I’ve been involved in before, so when they see me, some can say, “Really, God is doing miracles.

I mean, by now, about 14, 15 years.<br><br><i>How did you decide to become a worship pastor?</i><br><br>You know, it’s been my passion. In music especially, you know, ministering to God in music, praise and worship, music. So, you know, it was natural that, you know, that in the church that I go to, I belong to, they asked me if I could lead that department, so it’s always been like that. I’ve been the worship leader in the church services and heading the whole department of music in our church.",How did you decide to come to CAPA?,"A friend of mine recommended—he came to our church to update us about what CAPA is all about. So when I looked at the material and everything, I think the whole program, you know I quickly jumped into it.<br><br>And besides that, you know, before, I was looking for how I could update my theological or whatever hermeneutical education in the work of God. Because I believe that learning is progressive—you have to keep on learning. But, because of the full-term job as a pastor, I couldn’t find the right program that could give me the space that I could do the school, at the same time I’m also balancing with ministry.<br><br>So when I got the idea of CAPA, I said this is the right school to go for because it also gives you some space, you know after 2 weeks, you can go back to continue doing the pastoral work. So that flexibility is one of the things that attracted me to go for CAPA.<br><br>Besides that, the material is quite relevant to today’s ministry. And actually, it’s even from the days that I’ve been with CAPA—this is just the second week— but I can tell you that it’s an eye-opener, it’s… you just wake up to say, “Wow! I should have come to this much earlier than now!”",What are some things you are thankful to CAPA for?,"The content, number one, the content is so rich, is so relevant, okay. And it’s going to raise the standard—it’s raising us to a level whereby we can look at the Bible, we can look at the work of God in a different perspective which is more effective, which is actually true. We are learning quite a lot.<br><br>Number two, I just like, you know, the approach to the content. I think the teachers, the lecturers, I think they are just friendly, warm—you can ask questions, they understand you, that some of the questions may sound like, you know, they are not very sensible, but I think they accommodate all that. Now, that creates an environment whereby, one: it’s so free; you’re not intimidated, but you’re also, you can easily fit in, okay. The explanation is really up-to-date, that even somebody who is not up to speed, they still can catch up.<br><br>And maybe on a third note, once I arrived to this campus, I just loved the environment, okay. It’s truly a learning environment—it’s quite conducive to learning. Eh, maybe on a fourth note, I think the support stuff, okay. When we go to the office, maybe we have little question or want ask some resources, you know, the way we’re welcomed—it makes us to feel home! Okay? And everybody I think is wearing a smile on their face. I mean, that just adds value to the whole environment is quite encouraging, quite inspiring.",Do you have any plans for future ministry?,"Okay, if there’s one thing I keep dreaming about, is… because I think big, bigger than, I believe that I have to keep growing… so, I think even the pastoral ministry that I’m doing, or even being in the worship ministry, I’m thinking of how I think can just grow bigger, and reach out even to more territory, like crossing the borders and whatever, though the base is here in Malawi. So I’m just thinking of like, you know the kingdom of God doesn’t see any borders. Yeah, how we can just reach out to the unreached, okay, with new approaches that we have never done before. You know, the world is always changing, so that’s one thing.<br><br>Besides that, I’m also eyeing, you know I’ve been quite impressed by the master’s degree program. That’s the ultimate thing that I’m looking forward to. So I’m looking forward to when I can jump into that, so I’m working so hard about this, because, you know, the insight that I have now about the master’s degree program, to me it’s quite appetizing. Yeah, so I’m also looking forward to that pretty much. Then the rest will follow. Because, after achieving that, we’ll begin to do ministry much better.",What are some challenges you have faced in ministry? What has the Lord taught you in these challenges?,"Okay, um… some of the challenges that I have experienced so far, is that, most especially here in Africa, or in Malawi in particular, is that, you know, we’re coming from a background whereby some of the doctrines haven’t been really accurate, okay? Sometimes they are polarized to the wrong direction, okay.<br><br>So, I can give an example. Like, we’ve been preaching, you know, out of just thinking about our own way of thinking, without getting to the accuracy of what the Bible intended to speak to us or what God intended to speak to us. So we have created some doctrines—now, when you come with the truth to the people, you know it’s a bit hard for the people to adjust and accept that, because the other doctrines have been too dominant, okay?<br><br>I may have an example. It’s like, you know, the doctrine whereby people know God, just in one side, whereby God is there just to solve your problems. But, I think there is more; even after God solves your problems, I believe there is still life, you have to go on.<br><br>So, I think we have to… God wants us to respond to His love, other than just receiving a present from Him, okay. He wants the relationship to be paramount. So most of the times, when you teach about some of these things, for the people to remove the former things that they had and to be renewed, it kind of sometimes becomes a bit hard—it takes too long. I know with God, all things are possible, but sometimes it takes too long.<br><br>And at the same time, people—they rush for the popular gospel, which may not be the accurate truth, okay. The real truth, it’s like people are not very attracted to that. That’s another serious problem that I’ve encountered in ministry. So, I think basically, that’s that.<br><br>Ah, maybe I just forgot one: the other challenge I think in an African or a Malawian setting, is the challenge of resources, okay. I mean, resources are really challenge, okay. For you to get some more resources, additional resources, you know, we are living in a time whereby you need some aids, visual aids, whatever things like those to help you at least to be more effective in doing the ministry. That has also been a challenge, yeah sure. But we just look up to God and believe that God is going to supply, yeah sure.<br><br>In these challenges, I think one of the biggest lessons that I’ve learned is that it’s not by might. [<i>laughs</i>] It’s by His Spirit! You know, you can’t change people; it is only God who can change people, who can [make] changes. All of us, we are in the process of being changed, okay.",How did you come to believe that Jesus died for your sins?,"Right, I mean, it’s kind of funny. I came to believe that it was very rare to find a person who could tell you or explain something personal with God. Sometimes I could feel it, that there is God in heaven. But my understanding could not go further than that. So the only thing that I grew up with, and that conviction kept echoing in my heart when I was growing up saying, “There is God in heaven, there is God in heaven.”<br><br>I got born again in 1992, on the 2nd of February, 1992. Then I was still in secondary school in Malawi, we call it form 1? Alright. But… okay, it was in a students’ meeting—somebody came to preach. So, I got the message, and I responded to Christ. I raised up my hand, and received Jesus as my Lord and personal Savior. When I got born again, it was just like… it was easy for me, because I had found an opportunity whereby somebody explained further to me about God, and about Jesus being the savior.<br><br>And from that time, I’ve never looked back, and it has been a wonderful experience, and even if somebody tells me that heaven has been canceled, you know, I’ve just fallen in love with this God. It’s more than just going to church—it’s personal, me and my God. I just love this God.",What are some ways we can be praying for you?,"1) Um… [<i>pause</i>] I just want more of God, okay. I just want to savor Him, okay. I say to myself, God’s business is my business. Alright, so, the foremost area that I would need [prayer for], I just need more grace, okay.<br><br>2) If God can just give me more anointing, more ability, and at least more resources, that can like… you know, in the area of like music ministry, okay? You know, I understand—maybe you have been here in Malawi for quite some time—you can see that our standards may be set down a little bit because we sometimes lack good things that can help us to… I know! Music ministry is more about the heart, expressing to God. But also I think the instruments, they also help a little bit, okay?<br><br>3) And you can also pray for my family—you know, my children are still… my firstborn is supposed to go to college, if he gets the good grades, he’s supposed to go into university of college. The other ones, the two girls—one is still in secondary school, and that one is still in primary school. I would love as a father, to give my children the best education. So if somebody can want to pray for me and my family, please pray for us that we should educate our children—I think that’s the best legacy we can give them.",What is your favorite thing about Malawi?,"The favorite thing about Malawi is that… you know, I’ve traveled to a number of countries, but I’ve always loved something about Malawi: is that the people, they just love a community life, okay. There is nobody who lives an individual life—it’s like a “we” thing, okay.<br><br>We think about others, we think about the community, okay. I’ve gone to places whereby somebody lives in a house and does not care what happens to the next door. They don’t even greet each other, okay, it can take a week, maybe even a month! You know, it’s like everybody minds their own business.<br><br>But one thing I like about Malawi is that the people, they care about the neighbor, they care about the community. You know, they take an effort to get to know who lives in the same city, who lives in the same village. That’s the unique thing that I like about Malawi.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I can see it’s not easy, but it’s manageable. I need to rely on the grace of God to go through these 3 years.<br><br>On the ministry, we need the grace of God. People are very difficult animals, more than taming dogs, more than taming cats. You know, a human being is a very difficult person to live with. So we need the grace of God, to be sufficient on us, to be good leaders. We are humans, sometimes we can error, Lord should give us patience that we should be patient and that God will help us live a good life each and every day. We are the examples and they expect us to live a high standard life, so to live high standard life, we need God’s grace.<br><br>I got married in 2001, and I was expecting that when I was married I would have kids, but up to this time I don’t have a kid.

We really need to grow spiritually. We are also involved in a building project. You can pray for unity in the church, but especially spiritual growth for many of the members. Many of them were Muslims before they came to church, many of them need to know the Bible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What is your current ministry?,"Ah, I would say, pastoral work is on my heart. Despite that right now I am not pastoring a church, but pastoral work is on my heart. Ah, for instance, in my church, I lead the youth, which, in your context you say, youth pastor. The youth will range from 14 years to 30. I also teach Sunday school, yes. And I’ve been working with the youth for over 15 years, yes.<br><br><i>So then what do you usually do for the youth ministry? Do you go through a book in the Bible?</i><br><br>Yes, we do Bible studies and counseling, and sporting activities, and ah, there is a lot… traveling around, visiting other churches, and having retreats, yes.<br><br>Oh! By the way, right now I am involved in prison ministry. Yeah, I got introduced to prison ministry when I was in college, that is as of 4 years ago, and I do prison ministry at Maula Prison with another friend of mine who is a graduate of ABC [African Bible College] we were together at ABC. So, that’s where my heart is.<br><br><i>How long have you been with the prison ministry?</i><br><br>Ah, 4 years now? Yeah, 4 years—almost 5 years. Yeah, in the prisons we do Bible studies, we preach, ah, we encourage those guys, ah… that is on the spiritual part. But on the physical part, we also help them with the transportation and stuff.",What do you think God has taught you through the prison ministry?,"[<i>smiling</i>] One thing that I have learned through the prison ministry is that those. Are God’s. Children. Because before I was introduced to the prison ministry, I was very afraid. I thought of those people—when I looked anyone who has been in prison, or anyone who is in prison, I thought that was the worst person on earth. So, when I was introduced and as time went by, God began teaching, “My life, that what you see, is what I died for.” And that has brought my love close to those people.<br><br>And actually, I have seen many coming out of prison, changed people. One of them we have right here [in CAPA]— he is doing the diploma [program]! Maybe one time I will show you. It’s very amazing indeed, and I am always proud when I see him—I see the Lord at work.",What do you think are some challenges you’ve faced in ministry?,"Ah, one of the major challenges that I would say… it is whereby you are coming to a point where maybe people may not actually understand what you are driving it. Say for instance, ah, I am teaching, and some people don’t really understand what I am talking about. And it is because of their level of spirituality, to such an extent that to me, I feel that I am not reaching that extent where I want the people to comprehend what is being taught and what the Bible is saying.<br><br>Ah, the other problem, like, amongst the youth is, I would say, they are like… slackening. Like right now, my youth group, there has been a time where they are slackening in their spiritual life, which, myself together with the other team members, we are trying to rebuild that, whereby we have seen some girls falling pregnant, and some boys dropping out of the system, and stuff. So that’s one major challenge.<br><br> And the other challenge is financial issues, whereby I would like to go out and minister, but put things together, or we need to have materials, like I was talking about sports where we need to have balls and uniforms, and we don’t have finances, so that also acts like a hindrance towards ministry.<br><br><i>Why do you think that recently, the youth has been slackening in their spirituality?</i><br><br>I would say, ah, where the church I am right now, I joined the church two years ago—you try to move to a location where you’ll be able to manage—so it was like the previous leaders that were not taking care of their needs. So that’s what we are trying to build right now, that, it’s like we are trying to build a new history out of the old one.",What are your future ministry plans?,"I look forward one day someday, that I will be… a lecturer, at a university or college level, yes. I would like to teach stuff like hermeneutics, yeah? [<i>laughs</i>]",How did you come to believe that Jesus died for your sins?,"Ah, I would say… I have grown in a church-going family. My parents and my grandparents were those who would teach us the word of God, and in our home, we used to have prayer meetings, within our family—prayer meetings every Wednesday. And of course on Sunday we would go to church—I remember when I was very little, my brothers and sisters and uncles and cousins, they would sing together in the church, like a family choir, something? Yeah, so I came to know some things about the Lord.<br><br>But as I was growing, I tended to find my own way. Not necessary in the sense where I would say I was rebellious , but my mind would tell me, “What about this? What about this?” And it came to a time, whereby I realized that what I was thinking… wasn’t what the Lord wanted for my life. So I would hear the sermons in church, but there were at that time whereby, my ears were closed. Yeah.<br><br>But, this time, the grace of the Lord opened up my ears, I realized that… I am not just supposed to go to church just because it’s Sunday. But I have to go to church with a purpose. So, I was convicted, I went back to my church, I confessed to my pastor, I got baptized. And, I began praying, that “Lord, give me your direction. Not mine, but your will.”<br><br>And I would say that from there, I found the thing that I loved as a person, they were no longer attractive. And I began following the Lord, and the Lord has been leading me since.",What are some ways we can be praying for you?,"1) Ah… be praying for my family. I’m married—my wife and I, we have a daughter who is 6. So be praying for my family. I love family—I love my wife, I love my daughter, and they are a source of inspiration in my life.<br><br>2) Be praying for the studies that I am taking right now here, because, as I’ve said, I’m looking forward to this to change my life, so that I may be able to impart the knowledge to other people’s lives and change their lives.<br><br>3) And ah… be praying for my… right now I need to go back to my employers and talk to them if they will give me chance, that I will be able to manage both work two weeks, and the other two weeks I am in class. So, I need prayers in those areas, that the grace of the Lord will go before me—even before I speak to them, that the answers will already be there.<br><br>4)Yes, and of course, my relationships with my fellow students. Since we are coming from different backgrounds, different churches, and we have just met, that our relationships will always be nice and good and work together.",What is your favorite thing about Malawi?,"Ah, my favorite thing about Malawi?

Our Bible, Chichewa Bible, doesn’t have references or commentary. Another challenge is that most of the preachers in Malawi don’t have proper training. This is then producing Christians who are half-baked spiritually. And then you end up struggling with these people because they hear different things. <br><br>The church in Malawi’s knowledge of being a Christian is very shallow.

Just because at that time, I had no knowledge about Jesus Christ, and I was just…when I heard somebody preaching, I felt that it was just a waste of my time to listen to the Scripture.<br><br>By and by, I remember at one point in time when I was at secondary school, I got sick, and surely I was near to die, is when my brother-in-law, somewhere, come and paid me a visit. And he was…at that time, a believer, a true believer, is when he encourage me and giving me the word of God, yeah.<br><br>I’m still remembering the Word, it was the scripture from Acts, whereby there was a conversion of Saul.

How did you come to trust in Jesus as your Lord and Savior?,"Initially, I got born again in the year 2007. I knew Christ in 2006, I knew about God. But here, you are considered Christians if you go to church. 2006, I was in school and some guys used to preach to me about Christ. “You need to be born again, you need to be born again. You need to know Christ.” They kept coming and I said, “Okay, these guys stop nagging; let’s be born again. Let’s pray the Lord’s prayer, the sinner’s prayer.” I prayed the sinner’s prayer. But it wasn’t coming from my heart, it was coming from my mind because of the pressure I had from these guys.<br><br>In 2007, when I was living the Christian, doing mixed things. I still felt empty inside of me; I never felt the assurance in me. I didn’t have that assurance. My spirit had never testified with the Spirit of God that I am a Son of God when the spirit of God just gives you that love or that testimony inside of you that you are a son of God.<br><br>It was that time in 2007, when I felt so empty and I was like, “Do I really know God?” I examined myself and I saw that my faith in Christ wasn’t really founded in the Gospel. The faith that Jesus Christ is Lord, that I’m saved by grace through faith, because I tried so hard to save myself by not doing the wrong things. But at that time I was like, “God, on my own I can’t, I need you to take control.” I know Christ finished the work for me on the cross. And I gave my life. So from that time I was born again in 2007.",Why did you decide to become a pastor?,"l felt the call to ministry. It’s not just a feeling, feelings come and go. I feel inclined to teach and preach the Word of God and disciple people. After I graduated in master’s in communication, I had in mind that I wanted to do a master degree or a first degree in theology. I’ve always had it in mind that I’d do it later on.<br><br>The times that I’ve spoken the thought that, “I want to be a pastor, I think I’ll be a pastor.” That’s the reason I had a debate between do I want to be a pastor or do I want a degree in pastoral or mass communication studies. You know, something like this gives me perfect peace because I have passion for the Word of God and how it’s delivered. I believe I pray that I want to take the word just as it is and not be married to theologies or adulteries. But married to the Word and the leading of the Holy Spirit. That’s the reason why even before I knew about Reformed Theology, before Calvinism, I could say that I was saved through grace through faith alone. I didn’t have to learn the ideas of John Calvin, [because] it is in the Bible. That’s why I came to CAPA and I said, “Okay, this is in agreement with my convictions.”<br><br>This is the first year of my three year journey and seems so long. Sometimes it is discouraging, but I’m hanging on, I’m trusting the Lord [because] with the friends that I graduated with in college have already started working. It’s a choice I make, because I could have started a job and made money. Who doesn’t want to make money? I feel like Abraham right now. I don’t know where I am going but God has promised that he is taking me to a place. I’m blind, but God is holding my hand.",What challenges have you faced in ministry and what have you learned from them?,"The first challenge I found it difficult is that you don’t convict people, but the message does. So some people just don’t grasp it sometimes and you don’t see the change in them, which is a burden on me because I expect that when a seed is planted, something grows out of it. And if it doesn’t grow, there’s disappointment. It’s very discouraging when I see that happen. <br><br>Secondly, the struggle is the information that is going around. For example, one minute you think you know something, the next minute you learn something new and you’re like, “Okay, has everything I’ve been teaching wrong? No.” It’s like you’re going to church and now you start coming to school and you learn the Bible in totality and you realize, “Oh, that you’ve said things about the Old Testament which are certainly not it.”<br><br>When you learn hermeneutics, there are some things that I’ve used for my own selfish ambitious. Like Matthew 18, whatever you bind in earth, is bound in heaven. And you use that to claim things. It’s like you have a meeting and you say “Good meeting, whatever is bound here is bound in heaven.” It’s talking about binding. But the Bible is talking about reconciliation, not about agreement of discussion.",Is there anything that you’ve learned through these things?,"Prayer. There have been times when I’ve been in very tough situations as a Christian, not only as a Christian, but as a young leader, I’m a youth leader. And the situation, we’ve prayed about and I’ve seen God move with power and change situations and reconcile people.<br><br>I know one situation where two people were in a very bad relationship. One even stopped coming to church and I took the other and asked if they’d reconcile. And we took to prayer as a team. And now they’re best of buddies. I’ve seen God is able and God is real. I’ve seen God be real to my life, he speaks to me in situations where I do not know what to do. He comes along and gives me wisdom. God is real.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So, I pursued that conviction and became a pastor...about 2 years after I was saved, yes.",How did you come to believe in Christ?,"I was at college then, so a friend of mine came to me and asked me if I could go to his church, so he invited me. So I went there and attended the service, and when the preacher preached, I felt convicted, and I realized that I was a sinner, I realized I needed Jesus.

What has the Lord taught you through these challenges?","Yeah, there are so many challenges that comes in ministry. The major one being resources that we need. The other challenge is, pastor a church is more challenging—you’ve got to have, you have always a tight schedules. Lots of things to do—visiting people, preparing sermons, preside over funerals, etc. Then you have family at [the same] time.<br><br>The Lord has taught me through these challenges that His presence is sufficient. His grace is sufficient whether you’re working under pressure or you’ve got less work, His grace is sufficient, and He is the one that strengthens us. So that has taught me to rely upon Him, no matter how much is on the schedule.","You attended CAPA for your Advanced Diploma. Did coming to CAPA change the way you did ministry, or the way you preached?","Yes, yes, it really helped me to change the way I do ministry, the way I preach, the way I approach the Word of God. I think it’s different right now, because many times before you just go into one Scripture, pick it, then you preach it without doing a proper observation as we are taught here.<br><br>And also, I used to preach [topical] messages; they were all [topical] sermons, but now I am doing exposition, book to book, verse to verse. So, yeah, it has been so helpful—I think it has brought out enlightenment in my life and in my ministry, sure.",What did your congregation think when you started using expository preaching?,"They like the expository preaching so much.

I didn’t want to join that, but now there was this day when this group was supposed to go out to attend a crusade. And I, as a troublesome, said that I will join them because it gave me a chance to go out of class. And when I reach the venue, I will go away and go home.<br><br>The preacher started preaching, and from nowhere I found myself in front with the other people. And up to this day, I say it was really grace. Because when they were preaching, everything was saying, “You are cursed.” So I said, the message came to me strongly. I said, “Lord, I’m really cursed, save me.” So I started explaining to the preacher I used to do this, I used to do this. The pastor said, “The Lord will forgive you. Just follow me in this way and pray together.” That was the moment of my change. From that day to now, I follow Jesus Christ. Yes, we fail sometimes, but I know, that the Lord will help me, and his grace is sufficient because it saved me and it will keep me.",Why did you decide to become a pastor?,"You know, I was a troublesome young man. In those days I used to throw stones at ministers of God. But after I received Jesus Christ as my personal Lord and savior, I was called into ministry when I was still 19. My pastor saw in me that there was that passion to go into full time ministry. I didn’t realize at first. But he said this because the first thing that I told him I wanted to do is preach to my fellow friends with whom I used to throw stones at pastors.<br><br>The message was a very simple message, but three of my friends that I used to interact with, they received Jesus Christ. So the pastor said, “I see ministry in you.” I didn’t like that because, I could say, ministers of God suffer, even their children. But now after two years from that, he saw that passion in me again. I told him I went to go study theology and he said, “Oh! I told you!” It was a confirmation of being called. Because I sensed that there was nothing I enjoyed at that time as much as preaching the Gospel. So that’s how I started.",Why did you decide to attend CAPA?,"You know, as a pastor in my church I was assigned to train other pastors. In our church, we have a system where by the local church pastors are not that all educated, but we choose them to help us in ministry. Trained pastors are very few. So then, we select these few and train them. I was one of these pastors who were selected to train them. So I found it very important to go and study further because I only had a degree and I could not finance my further studies. But I found that CAPA is there to help because even their fees are reasonable. It’s like it’s free because almost everything is paid for us! So I said CAPA is the place for me to be. <br><br>And above all that, those who train us here are also pastors, so they are experienced. You know, it’s good to be trained by people who know what they are teaching you. But here, I know that being trained by someone who is in the field is like he’s giving out his experience to you. That’s why I like CAPA. The fees and the lecturers are experienced in pastoral ministries. I hope to deliver that same experience to the ones I’m teaching.",Any prayer requests you’d like to share?,"Continue to pray for me so that I should remain in the ministry and remain in the Christian life. There are many things that come up in the Christian life. Sometimes you feel like quitting the ministry. As a young man, who finds pleasures here and there, I ask you to pray for the grace of God",What’s your favorite thing about Malawi?,"I enjoy going to the lake. If you go there, I’m telling you, it is very wonderful to be there. Just to go and swim with people.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Amidst the challenges that he has faced in 18 years of pastoral ministry, Alfred remembers: “I as a minister of the gospel, my work is to serve people.”",https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/capamalawi/Goliath%2C+Alfred+Final+Cut+1.wav,,Alfred shares about his plans for future ministry after CAPA.,,"Alfred, are you a pastor right now? How did you decide to become a pastor?","Yeah I’m a pastor, I’ve been a pastor for almost 18 years within Lilongwe. The name of the church is New Jerusalem Pentecostal Church.<br><br><i>And how did you decide to become a pastor?</I><br><br>Of course, it’s a long story, but just to cut it short maybe I can say… it was 1995, yeah. 1993, ‘94 is when I got born again, you know? And I was fellowshipping with a certain ministry. Yeah, and from there I went to northern part of our country, it’s called Mzuzu, you know?<br><br>So, when I was there is when I received this passion, yes, to serve God. Yes. But, you know… it was like, when you have that passion to serve God, it appears like someone is speaking to you, you know? Concerning this work of ministry.<br><br>Yeah, so, up until we had a conference, and our senior pastor came, and during the conference, is when my senior pastor confirmed that God has work for me, that I need to serve Him. So then, I went to the Bible school that we had at that time, just to be trained [for] the work of the leadership, the ministry, yeah, sure.",Can you tell me more about how you were born again?,"Okay, yeah, that was in… 1994, yeah, sure. At that time, you know, I was staying with my brother-in-law there at my home village. So while I was there, it was my brother-in-law who preached to me—yes, he testified to me about the goodness of the Lord.<br><br> Sure, yes, so now I said, “Ah, but how can I join this family of God?” Then he said, “Now, it’s your decision! If you make a decision to obey what I have told you, simple: just pray. Let’s pray together,” then we prayed. Ah, in fact, from there, when we recited many prayer, then I felt… relief in my heart. I felt peace in my heart.<br><br>Ah, actually, before I got born again, I did not involve myself in many evil things, like maybe some other people can witness. Yes, but I think my main problem was like, though I was a young man, but, not that I was a drunkard, but I was drinking beer, not as a drunkard, but because my mother—the business that she was involved was brewing beer.<br><br>Yeah, so when I was in primary school, I was also doing that work, assisting my mom, mixing the beer. Yeah, so in the course of doing that it was like me, I was drinking! But, yeah, when I got born again I said, “No, this is not the work that I am supposed to do.” Then also I pushed to my mom, “You know, you need to change. This is not the right business for you, because God is not pleased with this.” So she stopped, then also I told her, “Maybe you can choose another business.”<br><br>So, how I got born again, I think just to cut things short, it was like that—my brother-in-law witnessed to me about the coming judgment, and also the grace of the Lord, sure. Then I accepted the Lord as my Lord and Savior.","In your 20 years in ministry, what are some challenges that you have faced?","The challenges, ah, the main part is like, this is the work of the Lord. So, even the Lord Jesus Christ told us, when we are doing this work which the Lord has left for us, the Bible says: if they persecuted Jesus Christ, they will also persecute us. Yes, you know what? If they denied Jesus Christ, they will also deny us! Yeah, sure.<br><br>So, that is the challenge, because when we are doing this work of the ministry, we meet different people. Some people they can pretend like, ah, yes, they love the Lord, they have a passion to work for God, [and] at the end you find that [those] people have brought the problems, like dividing the group, like… enticing, you know? Deceiving other people to follow them, eh? So, that’s the first challenge.",What have you learned from those challenges?,"Sure, I as a minister of the gospel, my work is to serve people. Yeah, so, what I’ve realized is that challenges, helps me… they do prepare me for the coming work ahead of me. Like I’m going to meet some other people, eh? [They] will come to me like “Pastor, this is what I’m going through.” But because myself, I already passed through that, and I know how God encouraged me, how God dealt with me, then I am able to encourage that person!<br><br>You know spiritually, I thank [the] Lord that I was persecuted, I suffered. But it helped me to learn Your Word. It helped me to get sharpened, you know? Yes, to know more about You, to know more about the issues of life, how to deal with them, how we can live in a wicked world—but! Keep on pleasing the Lord, keep on serving the Lord faithfully, preaching the Word without compromising.",What are your plans for future ministry?,"By God’s grace, it is me who do not know what will come, eh? After this. But you know my passion for the ministry, or my future plans is that this work of the gospel needs to go, eh? Everywhere. It needs to go far. Especially starting from our country.<br><br>So my passion is that I need myself to learn more about the truth of God’s Word, so that what God has taught me, I should also teach other people. That is my passion, to preach to gospel, to continue preaching the gospel, and also preparing other people for the work of the ministry.<br><br>So with that has brought in me a passion that, “Why can’t I just start maybe a discipleship class?” Teaching people, preparing people, telling them that I’ve realized that God has pushed something in this ministry that you need to be trained. Not just for the work that is being done here, but also for other people, different places.<br><br>That’s my future plan, I want to equip more people, yeah, so that they can go and serve the Lord. Because people cannot come to the Lord if there are not ministers, sure.",How did you decide to join CAPA?,"It has been my heart, it has been my passion—where can I get a school that teaches the word of God? Because there are many institutions, but they are not focusing much on the word. But here, I believe that this is what God is doing. Yeah, sure.","Now that you have been exploring Scripture and diving into God’s word, do you see spiritual growth in your church?","Yeah, exactly, exactly, exactly. There was a time I taught about this issue of church discipline. You know, my church had a problem of how to deal with some of the issues that people are doing, you know? Like, when one member sees his brother, that what he is doing is not right, what they used to do is just go to somebody and say, “You know, you know what our brother is doing, you know? Tsk. You know what our sister’s doing, you know?” So it becomes like gossip! It’s like gossip!<br><br>So then when I learned this issue of church discipline, then I went to the church! So, from that time I taught this issue, this scripture, I tell you the church is good. Yeah. The church is good. Now they are able, they are able now to meet each other, and help each other, you know, pray together, yes.<br><br>You know, before, before it was like us telling people, not like “This is God’s command, this is the word of God, you must obey it.” The people should obey the word of God, but [it was] not like in the sense that they are obeying God, but that they [were] obeying us, eh?<br><br>But when you exposit the text to people, it means when the people obeyed God through His word, it means the people will get connected to God. You remain where you are—you never go up and say “I am the one.” No, no, no.",What are some ways we can be praying for you?,"1) You know, the first thing is… pray for me, that God should always, always help me to live holy life. I need to live holy life, because, I am a preacher. I am a pastor. I need to bring a good example to the people. So, that is my passion because the Bible says, “Blessed are the pure in heart, that will seek God.” So, that is my request to God. [That] God [would] always show me the areas I need to amend, the areas I need to change, show me Father, because what I need most is [to] seek God, the day He will come.<br><br>2) Number 2 is to pray for me that when I am preaching the gospel, God Himself must speak through me as He opens my eyes to the scriptures. Yeah, yeah, I need to preach the truth. Because nowadays, you know, people are preaching, but not the truth. Men are not preaching from the truth, so it is my prayer, that God make me a minister of the truth.<br><br>Yeah, because other things I know, God has already made promises. When I am faithful in doing His work, He will supply all my needs. He will protect me, He will give me water, give me food, everything. I will lack nothing. So there’s no need to say, “This is what I need,” no! What I need is just to be faithful. Seek first His kingdom and righteousness—the other things you are looking for, they will just be added to you. And also God says I am blessed! I’m not poor, I am blessed! So I need to have faith in the word of God.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have a passion for the gospel and for ministry. I feel like it is good that I should become a pastor so that I can teach the Word of God to other people. As Jesus said, “Go and teach the world. Teach them, baptize them.”<br><br>I was just 18. It was difficult for me because people were saying, “Don’t do this, don’t do this,” even up until now people are still against it. I only do what God says I must do, so if God says I should do this, I should do the ministry.",Are you currently the pastor of a church?,"I am currently not, because in my [Presbyterian] denomination, we have to explain that we feel a calling to our pastor or to church elders so they will examine you and report back to the session (which is the group of people that discuss church issues).<br><br>The year after I did that, it was 2012, and they said, “You are too young for this according to the doctrine of our church.” Thereafter, they said I have to wait up until I reach 27 years [of age]. So I said, “OK, what should I be doing as I’m waiting for that 27 year mark?” I wanted to go to ABC [African Bible College], so I underwent the application process, and I was successful, but I failed to go there because I had nobody who could sponsor me. I don’t have my mom, and my father passed on many years ago.<br><br>So since then, I thought I should come to CAPA. When I heard about CAPA, that was last year, so I decided, “Let me go to CAPA and get the required skills.”",Why did you decide to attend CAPA?,"The reason I chose to attend CAPA was because I have this interest that I should be teaching the right stuff, or the right message, that is not the twisted gospel where some people think, “It is like this.” No—but I should teach what God says I must teach. Sometimes we learn something for the sake of teaching others, or we read the Bible for the sake of others.<br><br>When I heard about CAPA, it’s like, “You understand the Bible first for yourself, and then you practice what you’ve learned, and then you teach others to practice as well”; it’s do as I do, so you don’t just “do” as the Pharisees and the Sadducees were doing.<br><br>I felt like I should come to CAPA so that I should be trained. It’s good for me—nowadays, I do have opportunities to preach. So when I preach, I should be preaching the right stuff due to the training that I’m getting at CAPA.",What is your current ministry?,"Currently, I’m just working as a deacon. Sometimes they take me as a part of the evangelism committee. I only preach as an evangelist, but I want to be not just an evangelist, but after evangelizing, I also have to teach them so that I should mold them and build them for Christ.<br><br><i>What does an evangelism committee do?</i><br><br>The evangelism committee is where they organize evangelism rallies, outreach programs, maybe some conferences, especially for building the churches. We go, and we preach the gospel. It’s like outreach.<br><br>So we are there to say, “Which area should we explore for the time being so that we should teach them the gospel so that they should come to church?” So after teaching them, winning souls to Christ, thereafter we decide to build a church.",What are your future ministry plans?,"My ministry plans for the future is that, number one, I should preach the truth. I should teach the people. I should give words of exhortation, because we are in the last days, where many people are preaching the prosperity gospel, which I and the Bible, we are against that.<br><br>As I will be preaching to them, I know there are people who are sick. But I cannot be preaching just about sickness the whole day, or prosperity the whole day. I know, as the Bible says in the book of Matthew, that God knows what you need, all these things.<br><br>People nowadays, we focus much on prosperity: you get riches, or you do these things. It’s like we give them false hope. I don’t want that. I should give them hope that though we are suffering today, at the end of the day, when Christ comes, we will have eternal life.","What are challenges you have faced in ministry, and what have you learned from them?","So far, as a young man, the first challenge after hearing the calling is that I thought they will accept me, though I am young, so that I should go and do the work of God. So I felt lots of challenges.<br><br>You know, we usually have some church elders who are not born again. And sometimes when you preach different from what they think you should preach, they think, “Oh, this guy is pompous.” I am not like that! So that is a very big challenge. I have already waited for a year, and now I am waiting four years.<br><br>When I see that the church is going astray, I feel sorry. I feel like when people are doing bad things, I am also responsible, because if I am their pastor, I will be preaching the gospel full-time. But I take it as a privilege, because if I had gone out that year, I could not have attended CAPA.<br><br>The other day, I was with my reverend—I take him as my mentor—and he said, “You know, Blessings, go to CAPA. The training you will get there, though your church may not recognize it, but God will recognize it. The training that you get there, we do not provide it, so it will be for your benefit, and for the benefit of the church.” So what I learned is that God has a purpose for every situation that you are going through.",How did your reverend hear about CAPA?,"My reverend was at ABC [African Bible College, where Brian Biedebach is a professor], so as he was there, he heard about this school. He was doing his master’s and graduated this year. He heard about it through ABC because he told me like that Jim was once there. Yeah. <br><br>He told me [CAPA] is a good school, and go, because of courses in expository preaching and stuff, and the course that are being offered there, like systematic theology. Myself, I love systematic theology, and even expository preaching, because there are lot of mess which people preach in the village, because we don’t know anything, we don’t know the Scriptures, so we just preach for the sake of preaching. We preach what we think the Scripture says, not what God says in the Scriptures, yeah.",How did you first hear about Jesus? How did you come to believe that Jesus died for your sins?,"I was raised up in a family that didn’t believe in Christ. They are Christians, as we are called Christians, but my father was a drunkard, a womanizer. All sorts of evil things. And, eh, it took me time to come up to know about Christ. So I was growing up as a child, I could do all sorts of evil things in the first place as an evil child.<br><br>So it was in the year 2010 when, ah, there is a group in the secondary schools which is called Student Christian Organization of Malawi, commonly said “SCOM” [pronounces as “scomm”]. I said, “No. Let me go and see what they do.” So I went there. Somebody preached a very touching message.<br><br>He was talking about the last days, and I felt like he was just talking to me. So it’s like, I felt like I have no peace in my heart. And if I am to say I should not repent today, then these things will happen to me. By the end of it, I will go to hell. So what way to let me repent today? <br><br>So he said, “Those people who want to give up their lives to Christ, they should stand.” So I stood, and then he made up a confession prayer, so I did just that.<br><br>Thereafter I felt the Holy Spirit, and since that day, I saw my life changed, and I never wanted to do the things I used to do. I liked beating people, yeah. I have a short temper—I was short-tempered back then. So I could do all those things.<br><br>But since the time I made that confession prayer, I believed in my heart that today Christ has entered in my life, so the Bible says, “Whosoever is in Christ, the past has gone and he is a new creation.” It is from the book of 2 Corinthians, chapter 5, verse 17, if I’m not mistaken. So I knew, and I know up to date that my all my past is over, and the new has come. I am a new creation in Christ Jesus.",What’s your favorite thing about Malawi?,"Favorite thing about Malawi… I personally love Malawi because yes, we hear about conflict in other countries, but in Malawi, it is a peaceful country. So I love Malawi because it is a peaceful country, and, it is a country where if you want to minister the gospel, you can minister freely without any interference.",What prayer requests do you have?,"1) Ah. The time being, my prayer request is that God has called me, and, uh… I am having lots of challenges that I’m going through because I said I’m living with my uncle, but in the true sense, I’m not really with my uncle. I’m living [with] someone who has just like adopted me, because I don’t have my mom, and I don’t have my father. So I have financial challenge, and ah, yes, we are people who are spiritual, but we also need the physical—I mean, the basic needs. So my prayer is, help me to pray that God should give me peace because Jesus said that in this world, you shall have trouble, but in Me, you shall have me. That is from the book of John 14, if I’m not mistaken. So I should always have peace..<br><br>2)Because of stress, I even now have ulcers, peptic ulcers, because I could think too much, but He even give me that problem of ulcers, and I thank God that nowadays, I am having peace as I am here. I feel like I am at peace because I am seeing my dreams coming to pass. So my prayer is that my calling should remain permanent and I should do the work of God for the rest of my life. Though many other challenges, God is providing for me, and He will keep providing for me for the rest of my life.",What are some things about CAPA that you are thankful for?,"First thing is the affordability of the school fees. The school is very affordable. And this thing of training pastors at an affordable—because many pastors, it’s hard for them to raise funds for themselves.<br><br>Now the fact that CAPA is offering that training at an affordable price, it is giving them room to come and study. And the knowledge that they will learn from here, it will expand the kingdom of God.<br><br>Another thing is that what we learn is quite interesting, and I believe by the end of the day, many souls will be brought to Christ.<br><br>So that’s why I love CAPA because of the affordability and the quality of the education which is being offered there. They are teaching us how to understand the Bible, not as we think, but as God—so we should understand the Bible as it is, and we should preach as it is, not adding what we think—“I think it is like this”—no, no. Yeah. But we should just preach the Bible as it is, as God says it is. Yeah.",,,,,,,,,,

I’m serving under my pastor, Newton [in the M.Div program at CAPA], as an assistant. I just found myself involved with a church plant, kind of just at the center of a new church plant, and I happened to be one of the leaders there, so I think it’s God’s call on my life to be a pastor! [<i>laughs</i>]]<br><br>Anyway, my interests are going there towards that direction of serving God in the church, my local church. Yeah, it’s that burning desire to serve God in the local church.",Why did you decide to attend CAPA?,"Well, for a number of reasons. Firstly, I very much appreciate what CAPA is doing. I’m very much in agreement with the statement of faith. But also, I looked at the content, the stuff you are teaching here at CAPA, very much in agreement with the content. But the other fact is that CAPA is very affordable for me. Looking at the stuff that you’re teaching and the fee that is attached to all this, it’s just affordable.",What is your current ministry?,"Well, in my local church, I do preach at times when my pastor is not around. I’m involved in evangelism, visiting people in our church… yeah. I almost do everything the pastor does at our church. [<i>laughs</i>]]",What does evangelism look like?,"We encourage our members to be evangelizing wherever they go. We’re not really saying that this particular day is for evangelism, although we do have a day for evangelism at least once a week. But we encourage them to go out there to reach out to people.<br><br>And whenever we’re out there meeting with people at work or different things, we make it intentional to share the gospel. And much of the people we have [at our church], we have met them through that way, maybe at work, or just maybe on the road.",What are your future ministry plans?,"Wow. That’s a difficult one. I wouldn’t say I really have plans. I just want to serve, be where I am and serve.<br><br>I’m happy to be doing what I’m doing right here at my church. But I’m also aware that I’m very young in ministry, by the way. I know the Lord may have a lot of things up ahead of me, so I just want to be ready for whatever is out there, you know, waiting for me. Right now I just want to serve at my local church.","What are challenges you have faced in ministry, and what have you learned from them?","Well, I guess I’m still learning, being young in ministry. But I think what comes out very clearly for a young church plant like ours is you really want people to come, you know.<br><br>Now, people don’t like the way we do things because we like to open the Bible and speak about the Bible and share the Bible. But people aren’t interested in those things. They would rather go for entertainment.<br><br>So at times, I’ve been tempted to use carnal means to draw people to ourselves. I think that’s been an issue for us, but gladly we haven’t yielded to that. We still believe in the sovereignty of God. God is able to do whatever, exceeding abundantly more than we need and ask Him, and in His own timing He will draw people to Himself.<br><br>So I guess what I’ve learned so far is to trust on the Lord in His own timing to bring people to us, not to use carnal means to draw people to ourselves. Like I said, I’m still learning. Quite young in ministry. [<i>laughs</i>]",How did you first hear about Jesus? How did you come to believe that Jesus died for your sins?,"Well, I was raised in a Catholic family, and everyone else at home is Catholic except for me and my younger brother. Since my childhood, I always knew that Christ died for me, but that didn’t just make sense. I mean, it was just a fact that didn’t mean anything to me. It just didn’t apply for my own life, if you know what I mean.<br><br>But this other day, I was back home flipping—playing with the radio, turning from one station to another. There was a preacher there on one of the radio stations, talking about the Bible. I got interested. I wanted to know more about the Bible.<br><br>So I started listening to that radio station like every day, and I eventually—what’s the word—I was able to tell which program comes at what time, and there was this guy I listened to before who got my attention, and I was listening to him every other day. Then through that means—as I was listening, there was this knowledge building up. And as the knowledge was building up, the more an interest was also growing for the things of God.<br><br>Eventually I believe I was saved, though people never told me [<i>laughs</i>] that to be saved you need to ask Jesus to come into your life. I knelt down the other day and asked Jesus to come into my life. But though I did that, looking back, I believe I was really saved. It was a gradual process of listening to messages on the radio, just this knowledge building up and my life being changed.",Do you remember who the pastor was on the radio?,"Oh, yeah! I remember the pastor—he’s a friend on the radio to me, you know what I mean? [<i>laughs</i>] It was pastor John MacArthur on ABC Radio. They used to feature him then at half past eight in the morning. Then they would also feature him on another radio station at midnight. So I would listen to him in the morning at half past eight, and then turn on the radio again in the middle of the night at twelve midnight. I learned a lot—I’m still learning a lot from him.",What’s your favorite thing about Malawi?,"Wow. Malawi… this is home to me, and there’s no better place than home, you know? So yeah. This is my home… pretty much that’s all.",What prayer requests do you have?,"I think our greatest need here—I mean, it’s the greatest need of the human race. We want to see people getting saved, especially here where there is so much confusion about the gospel of Jesus Christ. I want to see an explosion of the true gospel of Jesus Christ, and a revival. So we would appreciate people praying for us, praying for revival here. But also not only that, for biblical churches here.",What are some things about CAPA that you are thankful for?,"[<i>points to the whiteboard in the classroom</i>] Do you see that on the board?

And the other reason is that when I got born again, yeah, I happened to do just stay like that—I was not doing anything. But one day something happened!<br><br>Yeah, I was going to a certain fellowship, but the time I was going there, it was a night prayer—we were supposed to be there the whole night. I was kept, I was being reminded of a clear passage, when Jesus rose. Yes?<br><br>So there were two guys, they were coming from Jerusalem going somewhere. So when they were moving, Jesus accompanied them, and he said, “Do you know the guy you are talking about? What you are discussing, do you know exactly?” So the guys were saying, “You know, are you a stranger here? Don’t you know that Jesus has been crucified and rose again? Don’t you know this story?” Yeah? So, they were moving with Jesus—but they did not realize that it was Him.<br><br>So, on this day, something was in my head of this verse. Yeah, I was thinking about it, and I was tormented as I was going to that night prayer. When I reached there, the pastor there preached the same message! As I reached there, he preached the same message! Saying, “You know Christ? You have been born again, but you don’t really know who you are following.” Yes? So, I thought, “I am born again, yes. But I don’t really know Jesus.”<br><br>So, from that time, I wanted to go to a Bible school to know more about God. Yeah, so, I’ve been trying for some years, no chance. But this time, I saw an advert in the news about CAPA. So I applied, and I was picked to CAPA. Now I am here.",What would you like to do in the future for ministry?,"Yeah, in the future, what I want is to go deep in this. But I have not made a decision—I want to pray, God to take me somewhere.

What do you think you have learned from the challenges that the Lord gives you?,"Yeah, the first challenge is that when I came here, when some friends and relatives knew that I am coming here, and they said, “Are you out of ideas? You have nothing to do!”<br><br>Yeah, because, at the same time, when my wife died, after some time, I was out of job. So I have been, because my wife died in 2010. So from that time to now, I am not employed.<br><br>So when I decided to come here, people thought that now, I am desperate—I do not know what to do. Eh? People are thinking that maybe because I’m out of job, so, I as just want to find something to do. But they didn’t know my background, because what I am talking, what I am saying here happened before this happened.<br><br>I’ve learnt a lot, yeah. I’ve learnt a lot, because, so… I’ve been out of job all this time, but I still survive. I still have something at least to feed my family, and send my children to school. At least sometimes I struggle, but still more, I find a way.<br><br> God gives me a way, yeah. Though it’s a bit tough than before when I was working, because I would do whatever I want, yeah.

I met some people preaching the gospel along the street and of course, I did not have an appetite when I decided to attend their meeting. I originally didn’t like these people preaching on the street. I hated them so much.<br><br>But the preaching is just, I can feel, [sigh] I feel like I need this Savior. I need a Savior. I found myself lost looking at the message they preach. So I said “OK”, I accept Christ as Savior. I raise my hand, it was only me who accepted Christ just that time. The rest went away. So I accepted Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. From that time on, I became a Christian. A Christian that is not just a church-goer but a Christian on the basis that I accepted Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.",How do you become a pastor?,"I still belonged to Catholic up until I finished my secondary school. I went to Catholic seminary to become a priest. I went there and, know I’m going there, already born again. Two contradicting things are coming together. I couldn’t fit into the system and the system did not accommodate me, then I dropped out of the school, because of the faith I had in Christ Jesus.<br><br>That was another critical time that my parents and I locked heads, because they had high hopes in me going to the seminary and dropping from the seminary, that was a very shameful case for my parents. So I went home and they chased me out of the home. <br><br>I started hunting for jobs in town, just soon after, I could really feel the strong calling of God, saying, “You went to the seminary on your own but this time I’m calling you out to my ministry.” I was not very sure if that was God until I changed the church from Catholic to the Assemblies of God.<br><br>Now the pastor there, I told him this story, he helped me, and he raised me in the Christian faith, up to the point that he sent me to the school. That’s how I became a pastor.",What are your future ministry plans?,"After I finish my M.Div, what I want to do is I want to go as far as Ph.D. That’s my strongest ambition. I want to finish my studies with Ph.D. Possibly in the same divinity. I want to see myself going far, because I have a passion of ministering to big people. You know, in Malawi, a person like myself cannot just go to people in courts and preach to them. They will tell them, “Who are you? How far did you go through your school? Maybe you’re just crazy.” So if I have some papers backing me up, you have access to tell them something and they will listen to you. So I want to go as far as Ph.D.<br><br>I am also going all over Malawi preaching the gospel. Not only to the youths, but also to different groups of people.

And I want to continue with that work.",What challenges have you faced in ministry and what have you learned from them?,"The greatest challenge we have here is the support of the ministry. The moment we plant the church, to support the church is a serious challenge.

God can take you from zil [nothing] to somewhere, from nothing, as long as you believe in him. God opens the way where there is no way. So long as you trust him, believe him, pray on, don’t give up. So, so many challenges, but we have to just believe God. And I pray that God should help me to continue.

We go door to door, house to house. We want to plant churches so that we can put leaders there who understand the Bible and teach those villages. I would like to pastor a church, and experience more.

Yeah, you know, it’s another stage to really know Christ and be changed by Him. So, I heard about Christ all my life, but believing in Him, making a commitment to follow Him, happened when I was around 16. <br><br>It was like a funny experience, my friend took to the eastern part of Malawi, along the lakeshore. And he kind of abandoned me right there. I spent about 3 months in that village. It’s funny because I got so lonely, I could not reach my family, and any friend I had I couldn’t reach them. Instead of thinking of these people, I thought of the Christ I had been hearing about. I started reading Scripture and in the process gave my life to Him. I think I had the information, the knowledge, that this is how you can believe in Him. I followed through what I already knew, and put it in practice. Later, I introduced myself to some Christian friends who took me in, and helped me with the basics of Christianity. I came back to Lilongwe to continue that.",What is your favorite thing about Malawi?,"Malawi, under our founding president, there was this culture that was developed of respect, love, and care for each other, so that is what I like about Malawi. You see it everywhere, we don’t just watch somebody suffer. Malawian people are good people. They are sinners just because we are born in sin, but if you look at the way they do things, you discover they’re good people, friendly people. If you go to South Africa, and you introduce yourself as a Malawian, you will be easily trusted. Our identity is our faithfulness, trustworthiness, and our commitment to work.",What is one of your favorite verses and why?,"I love Luke 4:18-20. That’s where Christ is talking to the people, “The spirit of the Lord is upon me.” I love that Scripture because it is talking about the heart of the gospel, preaching the good news to the poor.

Because I thought like I needed to know what I’m doing.

If my job is to counsel, I need to understand, what is counseling, biblical counseling, how to counsel people using the Word of God and before you can counsel people, you should know the Word of God. So that prompted me to desire to go to Bible school. So that I can lay the Word of God properly. And apply the Word of God properly. <br><br>Because the problem that we have here in Africa is that we don’t have a formal training as pastors as leaders of the church. Most cases, people only have one translation of the Bible, sometimes you only have a Chichewa Bible, which is our mother tongue, and the language that is used you may not be in a position to understand. Because even the Chichewa language, not all of us Malawians speak. So it’s even hard to understand some of the Chichewa language. So that was in me, that I should go and get formal training of studying the Bible, so that when I teach, I teach the right things, what God wants people to hear and understand the right things.",Any prayer requests you’d like to share?,"In terms of ministry, people could pray that we should continue standing and living for Christ because this is the most challenging thing these times. Most people are joining the church because they want money [through the prosperity gospel], so for you to stand for Christ is somewhat difficult, you have to lower your standard and do what other people are doing [like preach the prosperity gospel, if you want] to have members. So people should pray that God should help us that we should live for Christ, whatever it is, to present Christ properly to people and to live for him.<br><br>Pray for my wife and my children. Pray for our family that we should be exemplary.

Sometimes, you can greet one another. It’s not something where I can come to you and ask you for information, and, “Can you help me? Can I come and help you?” There isn’t that openness.

Ernest Kanzangaza,Ernest,Kanzangaza,Kanzangaza_Ernest.jpg,Master of Divinity,Current,35,Lilongwe,Wife and son,"“Our generation today, people are focusing about you getting rich and all those things. But, that’s not the Bible way. The Bible first and foremost is salvation.”","Ernest is currently a Master’s of Divinity student residing in Lilongwe, Malawi. He came to the realization that he wanted to go to a school that teaches expository preaching when he would read footnotes in his Bible with references to Greek and Hebrew and think, “Come on, I need to understand this language, so that I can read the Bible and understand it.”",https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/capamalawi/Kanzangaza%2C+Ernest+Final+Cut+1.wav,,Ernest shares about the significance and the need for expository preaching. ,,How did you decide to join CAPA?,"I was running a ministry where I was preaching every Tuesday or Friday, when I saw… I realized that I needed some more formal education. And for some time, I wasn’t convinced of getting one. But when I married my wife, we began to talk about it, and she said, “Are you willing to do school so that you can really understand what you are supposed to do?” But then the challenge was, what type of school? I’ve always desired to do expository preaching, but then in Malawi, there wasn’t any school of that sort… until I heard about CAPA.<br><br>And a friend told me about CAPA—then I talked to the teacher who was teaching me in the previous school where I was. So the teacher said “Ah, let me see.” So he met with the teachers from here [CAPA], so, he recommended me to them. So they sent me to the program, so that’s when I came in. And when I went into the class, then I saw—what I really wanted was what this school was offering.","How come you wanted to do expository preaching and not business, or accounting, or something else?","When I gave my life to Christ, then I began to study the Word. So when I go to church, what I found out was mostly topical preaching, which was missing out on some other things. And I would ask myself, “Why don’t people talk about Daniel, the whole book, verse-by-verse? Why don’t people talk about Matthew verse-by-verse, explaining it to me so that I can understand it?”<br><br>And again, as I read the Bible, I could find the footnotes where they would write Greek, Hebrew, and I said “Come on, I need to understand this language, so that I can read the Bible and understand it… know how it was written, why it was written, and how did they understand it [when] they very first believed.” So that’s some of the things that pushed me to say, “I’m looking for a school that does expository preaching.”",How did you come to accept Christ?,"That was 2000, 9th May. I remember, really. I can’t forget that day, yeah. That changed everything.<br><br>I wasn’t a church person, per se. My parents weren’t church people as well. So going to church or not going to church, it was optional. You could go, you could not. So there was no problem with that.<br><br>So when I came through secondary school and I entered into college, a question bothered me—someone just asked me, “Who are you?” and this one was a friend. He knows me, you know, and he asks me, “Who are you?” But this one was a Christian already, he already believed in Christ. So I said… I had struggled to know who I am, so he tried to explain a bit. But later on I realized, no. The answer I gave myself was, “I am a created being.”<br><br>So I came to him and I said, “I am a created being.” So he said, “OK, fine—go and explore more.” So when I went back and beginning to understand I am a created being, who created me, and why did he create me, and what does he want of me? So, those questions.<br><br>But I had no answers, until this other day when there was this service at church, a school program. So I happened to go to attend the service—it was a Christian movement at a school. It’s called SCOM: Students Council of Malawi. They meet in almost every single school, colleges… this organization is there.<br><br>So, I went to attend, and I don’t remember what was preached, but one thing I remember was: if you die today, what is your fate? And the altar call was made, announced to be a Christian, “Come and accept Jesus as Lord and Savior of your life.” That was it.<br><br>So… that day I gave my life to Christ, and since then, I have always walked with the Lord.",Are you currently pastoring a church?,"Currently no, but at my church—I go to Presbyterian Church of Malawi—I teach Sunday school, and I am an elder. Yeah, so, I love teaching! Very much. Right now a curriculum has just been formulated, so two weeks ago, I was teaching on prayer. So, next week, we are supposed to begin to talk about, to go on in prayer, but looking at prayer and fasting.",How long have you been teaching Sunday school? What are some of the challenges you've faced in ministry?,"Five years now. The challenge that has been there is people [trying] to adapt to the new teaching of expository preaching. You know? They are used to topical and all those things—now you come in and begin to explain things. You take them to a passage and you’re trying to [explain, but] sometimes they look at you and they [say], “What is this?” You know?<br><br> And again, I’m not a pastor in this church, you know? Maybe, like, in a year, they can ask me to preach twice. And everyone who is coming—these other [men] are preaching topical. So you can see the gap. When you’re standing there and you say, “Okay today, we are looking at Matthew 5:3-4,” and you begin to talk about these ones—there are some who catch it! But tomorrow, it goes. Because when they come tomorrow, someone is coming and saying, “Okay today, we are doing James 3.” And he takes them all everywhere. So that’s one thing that has been a challenge.<br><br>The other area is resources—we are limited in resources. I thank God for CAPA, [that] they are able to give us resources. But truly, here in Malawi, resources are rare to come by. I can give you an example: the books we are getting here. Not only can we not be able to buy them, because maybe of financial constraints, but again! You can’t find them in any other bookshop in Malawi. You get it? So, how do I come to… yes, I’ve got the desire to preach! But when you have these other materials with you, they help you, they broaden your understanding, you know? That’s another challenge that we face as a nation, and again, as an individual. Yeah, you really need to study more, but you don’t have the resources to help you out to say, “Okay, how did these other people saw this verse? And how am I supposed to look at it?” And that’s it.",Do you have any plans for future ministry?,"I love, as I’ve already said, teaching. Yeah, so, I’ve been a young man, I’ve been a youth myself. Now I am in, yes mid-30s, I’ve been a youth. I’m [working] with youth right now. But the challenges I’ve faced, the very challenges I faced [during my youth], maybe now they are escalating [because] of the Internet, Twitter, and all those things. They are affecting a lot of young people. And I’ve always prayed and I’ve believed that God will give me a platform, where I’ve always desired to equip young people, prepare them in whatever way I can by God’s grace. <br><br>And what I want even still: I know, and I know, I will become a pastor… standing in my church, preaching every Sunday, even in the midweeks as well. And that’s my focus—to equip others, to train others. The way CAPA is doing with me, I just want to do the very same thing. That’s I think, that’s the only way I can repay CAPA—to go out there, equip some people, prepare them, not only for ministry, but for the Lord who is coming.<br><br>Because as I talked to some today—you see it, that, we’ve lost it. The way we preach in our churches, it’s not about, “Be ready. He’s coming. Behold,” and all those things. Our generation today, people are focusing about you getting rich and all those things. But, that’s not the Bible way. The Bible first and foremost is salvation; this guy, this woman, this young person, must be saved. And that’s our emphasis, and I want to emphasize those things—bring people to the Bible and show them the main thing.<br><br>So, in short, I just want to equip others, train others, make them realize their dream as well and what God has called them to be and to do.",Did the way you look at the Bible or the way you do ministry change after you did your diploma here at CAPA?,"<i>[immediately]</i> Yes. I’ve changed. The way I approach the Bible now—it’s different from the way I approached the Bible then. Because today, as I study, I want to understand it.<br><br>Previously I would just read for the sake of reading and memorizing the verses without bringing out, “Okay, this is what I’ve received. This is what God wants me to do.” So I wouldn’t really apply, or sometimes I would apply to others and say, “Ah, this one! It’s better off with that one, not me.” You know?<br><br>But today, when I’m going to the Bible, number one: it’s speaking about me, it’s speaking to me. And whatever I’m getting out of it, first it must apply in my own life. That’s how I approach the Bible these days. And it should minister to my life.",What are some ways we can be praying for you?,"1) Number one things: wisdom. Pray that God would give me His spirit of wisdom and excellency. That’s what I cry for. And that I would be faithful to Him, and Him alone. That’s the first thing. I always [tell] people when they ask me, “What do you want us to pray for?” I seek wisdom, that I can really be faithful to God—share His word, and be someone who is faithful to God. So to be filled with that—wisdom from God.<br><br>2) The second thing is that…[<i>pause</i>] The one thing I want is to be a pastor… in one church… the rest of my life, at once place. Building up people. And all that. So, what I would ask you to pray for me about whenever you remember me, is that God will guide me, and order my steps, that I should be able to do that, and to show me where He wants to [be].<br><br>Sometimes you can go, you can believe yourself and say “If I stand here, if I preach here, it will work.” [But] when God has not planted you, everything becomes in vain. So I don’t want to labor in vain—that’s why I’m asking you, pray that God will plant me where He wants me to be.",What is your favorite thing about Malawi?,"Favorite thing about Malawi… we are a peaceful nation. That’s one thing I love about Malawi. Where people, not that we don’t have unforgiveness and bitterness and all those things. They are there, you see them. But the fact that we are not violent… I just love it. That we are able to relate in spite of arguments and afflictions we may have, but we are able to work together, to live together happily, to support each other—we are open to each other.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And only this first week I was seeing how I can also assist the members in the church where I am serving. Yesterday, I was at the congregation, and I really started to give in what I already have from CAPA. So, I am really sure that this will really do something very great so that even the people at the congregation benefit from this material, sure.",What is your current ministry?,"As a church minister, there is a lot. But to be more precise, I am not a preacher, but I am a teacher. From what I did at Veritas [College], I was training other members.<br><br>So that passion, it’s still in me, so that I can also use the CAPA material to continue impart the knowledge, impart the skills, whatever that can be necessary for the church members so that they can grow spiritually mature, sure. <br><br>Because, I think I can say, this time here in Malawi, people have heard a lot of sermons, but they are lacking teaching. So, if people can know what to do, I think that’s far much better.",What are your future plans for ministry?,"My future plan, as I’ve already said, my initial purpose, my initial passion, is whatever I get, I shouldn’t keep on my own. And if at all, there’s any chance to continue with CAPA for more and more, more stages… like doctorate and the like, I am really eager.<br><br>Because, once I can get that, that will not be only for me. Like what Paul says in 2 Timothy 2:2, whatever you get, you have not to keep by yourself, but also share with others, so that you can at least understand the Bible better, sure.",What are some challenges you have faced in ministry?,"Mm, challenges… many people don’t really understand the Bible. Because somebody said, “An idle mind is the workshop of the devil.” Because if they are not equipped to understand the Bible better, they can have a lot of problems.<br><br>But I can see, in intensifying teaching the church members, they are gaining a lot, so [then] they can have time to maybe make some more problems in the church. Because we say, the church members are not good, they are not disciplined, because they are not taught what to do.",How did you come to believe that Jesus died for your sins?,"Ah…it’s a very good question. I believed Jesus Christ died for me because by virtue of what Adam and Eve did in the garden of Eden, we are born sinners. God had a very good plan with the first people. He wanted to have a good relationship with them. But because our forefathers Adam and Eve decided to disobey God, God started to work on a plan, how to bring this back.<br><br>So, being born from a woman, I knew I am a sinner, but God did a great deal, like what we see in Ephesians 2. If we read that from verse 1 up to verse 10, I think verse 1 up to verse 3 introduce the life of unsaved person, what does He do? Through grace, and I said, that grace, I’m within that, because Jesus Christ died for me.<br><br>And because Jesus Christ died for me, what should I do? I need to say, “Thank you God for sending Jesus Christ to die for me,” because I was worthy to be punished. But through what Jesus Christ did on the cross, I need to do something so that whatever I got, other people have also to get, sure.",What is your favorite thing about Malawi?,"I like very much God’s creation. Like, where I am serving right now, it’s a mountainous place. But the way I see those mountains, how they were created, I feel it’s really great. Like, there is certain preaching point whereby it’s like a stadium. There’s a very, very small ground, but it’s being faced by mountains.<br><br>So, always when I go there, I see the greatness of God. How could God try to create the fence, as people trying to make fence, brick fence, but God made that fence of the mountains. So, how God created different places in Malawi, it’s very wonderful—I really appreciate it. God cares for our country and has really beautified it, sure.",What are some things you would like people to pray for?,"I would like people to pray for… like here in Malawi, with the tendency, with the habit of poverty, we are… maybe good at copying things which doesn’t really praise God. It might be something coming in. So Christians, if we cannot wake up, we may regret it in the future.<br><br>So people have to pray for Malawi, that we shouldn’t take things which we don’t understand—even the issue which is coming maybe from the West as well, these marriages, man to man, woman to woman. We have to understand, what does the Bible say about this?<br><br>So if people could pray for these issues, the current issues, it’s really pathetic in our country. So, pray for things which can bring confusion in the future, like those marriages, gay marriages, the poverty issue; people have to be equipped so that they can get the support from whatever they are doing, not just getting from the people which they don’t understand.",What are some things about CAPA that you are thankful for?,"Ah, CAPA is doing a lot, because I cannot select that “this is good, this is good, this is good, that is bad,” but… I wish God to bless CAPA, bless the people who are facilitating like yourself [the interviewer], the donors who are doing a great job—may God continue to inspire and guide them so that they can get the best sources.<br><br>This CAPA program shouldn’t just run for some few years—many people have to benefit from this, and I am eager to say that if possible, I can continue to see that CAPA standard has to live like here. I need to be there as well. And I am sure I will continue to be where CAPA say, “We need our students to come up [to] this level.” If God allows, I need to do that, sure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I also help oversee some Living Waters Churches along Central Region. I’ve been a pastor for almost now 17 years, and I have been an overseer for 3 years.",How did you decide to come to CAPA?,"Of course, when I was working with Campus Crusades, we were working together with my good friend Gideon Manda [the Dean of Students at CAPA]. Yeah! So, one time when I met Gideon, he told me about CAPA, and explained to me, so far, that I was convinced to come. After coming here, I started with Advanced Diploma. And when I saw the course which CAPA is teaching, I was more convinced. I said, “This is the right teaching which is supposed to go to the rest of the nation.” So, I learned Advanced Diploma, and now I am in Master’s.","After you came to CAPA, did what you learned change the way you preach/read the Bible?","Yeah… CAPA has changed me, as its name is Central African Preaching Academy. So, they teach, especially on expository preaching, so that pastors should know the Word of God, divide the Word of God as it is. Not just I mean think about it, or either just preach in parables or just some stories in churches, but we should be able to teach the Word. We need to divide the Word, we need to expose the Word to people.<br><br>So the way they are teaching at CAPA, I have discovered that it is the right way because for example, you started with observation—you observe the text. Then you come to interpretation—you interpret the text. And there you apply! That text to the people to this generation. So, it’s more practical, I’m sure I can say it’s more practical.","After you practiced expository preaching, what did your congregation think?","Ah of course, my congregation… now, people are getting grounded. Because it seems previously yes, I was preaching, but I was not preaching in series. But now! I do preaching in series, maybe you take Romans and you started to go verse by verse, elaborating to people.<br><br>So people are able to understand the Bible very well, very well. And people also recommended me to say, “Oh! We see a change in you, Pastor Kapanda! Because the way you are preaching, I think something is changing.” So I see that it will completely change my church, and even the growth of my church now is totally changing.","You’ve been pastoring for 17 years now. In those 17 years, what are some challenges in ministry that the Lord has given you?","Of course, when you are in ministry, not all things are good. Sometimes you find things that challenge your life. And indeed I remember one time, the leadership of the church, of our church, they decided that I should go to do bigger work as an administrator of the church. And this happened when one of our overseers resigned without the leadership knowing that he will resign. So I went to do that job as an administrator for Central Region. And as I was doing that work, I saw that I was just doing paperwork, paying the salaries for the pastors and so forth, and I realized that I was missing something!<br><br>And the one thing which I was missing is that I felt that I need to be where God has called me—to pastor a church. Not necessarily just to play around with papers in the office. So I decided to the leadership, to say, “I want to go, or either you should give me a branch where I can pastor.”<br><br>And when the branch was identified for me to pastor, there were so many challenges. There was no money—the account of the church was closed. And the people told me to say, “the way you are coming from, we cannot manage to pay.” But I told them, God called me, don’t worry about anything, and God will be able to provide; whatsoever, he will provide.<br><br>And from the level where we started, we saw God taking us from the humble beginning and raising us higher and higher, and I have seen the faithfulness of God through the fact that other people say, “How?! Does this church change?” I just see God. God doing it.",How did you first come to believe that Jesus died for your sins?,"Okay, one time, I was singing in a choir in a Presbyterian church, and I remember our choir was called to minister at a crusade, where the evangelists organized it. So I went there as a choir, to sing at a crusade.<br><br>In the course of singing, as the preacher was preaching the Word, I got convicted. I felt that I am a sinner, and I surrendered my life to Jesus, and accepted Jesus to be Lord and Savior of my life from that time.<br><br>And after receiving Jesus, when we went back to our former church, the leadership called us, and they told us to say, “If anyone have received Jesus, we are excommunicating you from church!” So I was excommunicated from church!<br><br><i>Really? Why did they do that?</i><br><br>They said, “This is a false type of teaching,” during those days, because I received Christ in 1985. So, the teachings of becoming born again, receiving Jesus, were very rare in those days.<br><br>We could not participate in the sacraments and so forth. But still, I was just going to attend the service, and go back home, up until the time when God, I think, spoke to me, maybe to seek for another church. It’s when I joined Living Waters.",How can we be praying for you?,"1) I would prefer if you can pray for me, especially to finish my Masters of Divinity. I want the grace of God to be upon my life, the wisdom of God to be upon my life. If the grace and the wisdom of God can dwell upon me, that’s all I pray for upon my life.<br><br>2) And also my wife, I should also pray for my wife—of course she is a nurse, by profession. She did her diploma course, but next year she wants to engage herself to do bachelor’s. So you should pray that the grace of God should also be upon her.<br><br>3) I want my children also to go further in education, and also to fear the Lord, so that they should be able to be an exemplary to the world—Christians who follow the word of God. Maybe, I prefer some of my children to be maybe called into full-time [ministry].",What would you like to do in future ministry?,"The vision which I have, is that I want to make more disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ. Yeah, by teaching the Bible, by teaching the Word—the truth from the Word of God, so that people must be grounded in the truth of the word of God, yeah. So that’s my greatest mission: to make disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>You know, as we are in the last days, there are so many prophets who have rose up. And they are misleading people. I remember in South Africa, one of the prophet is leading the people to eat snakes and also some rats. They say, “Can you eat them? They sound like chocolate.” So, people, since they are blind, they are ignorant—they rush there, and they take a snake and eat it, thinking that maybe something’s going to change, a miracle going to happen.<br><br>So, as we are in the last days, we have a greatest challenge to teach the Word of God as it is, so that people should know the truth.",What is your favorite thing about Malawi?,"The favorite thing about Malawi is… tourism. [<i>laughs</i>] Yeah! You know, Malawi is a very interesting nation. And, it seems people doesn’t know key places where people can be able, just to relax and so forth. Maybe after preaching the word and so forth, it is good just to go to such places and relax a little bit. So, I like tourism as Malawians, yeah.<br><br>We have national parks and game reserves where they keep animals. There are all sorts of, like sometimes bays and so forth, where people can try to look. As I stayed at Area 1, at the lake, we have a wonderful fish which is never found in any country except for Malawi—this is called chambo fish.

But you know when you’re a kid you go to Sunday school, you do church and everything, but you don’t really have that very big meaning of who Christ is in your life.<br><br>So growing up, when I was at the age of 11, that was when I made a strong decision to say that I will follow Christ and I had that big picture of who Christ is. Nothing really happened, I was just convicted that I needed to follow Christ with my whole heart.",How did you become a pastor?,"Right now I’m not really an ordained pastor, but the work that I do is all ministry because I had two jobs just recently. I was a chaplain at African Bible College for the past two years. Of course a chaplain has to be someone who is an ordained pastor, someone who is married. I wasn’t all that. But for some reason they asked me to do the work.<br><br>I also worked with Logos ministries. At Logos, we train church leaders who have never been put in a theology program. So they’re given a chance to preach biblically. Basically, that’s what I’m doing. <br><br>I’m taking myself from when I was young to the decision of following this pastoral ministry or this full-time ministry. It’s all because of what Christ has done in my life. <br><br>I say my dad is a pastor, but with my mom, they divorced when we were really young. We faced a lot of challenges, but one thing my mom taught me was we live a life of prayer. So even though we go a day without food, we still trusted God. We see that he’s the one who takes care of us. <br><br>There is nothing else that I can give to Christ. There is nothing I can offer him to just thank him for what he has done. All the way from when I was young to this day. I have a passion to serve him. There is nothing else I could do on earth. This thing, always keeps me going, to serve Christ, and to love him even more.<br><br>The problem here in Malawi is that we have a lot of churches, but you’ll find there are very few churches and pastors who can handle the word of God faithfully. Learning from here after I graduate, I can serve God better because I can teach my fellow Malawians and Africans to handle the Word of God faithfully. That’s what we need basically in Malawi and I think it’s going beyond Africa.",What are some challenges you have faced in ministry?,"I’d say one of the challenges that I face one time is when you take the message to the people that you want them to learn, sometimes they can push back what you’re taking to them. Because maybe one of the doctrines that they are already in, sometimes it’s a wrong doctrine, but they’re bought in so much to that. So I think that’s something that really needs prayer when we go out to reach other people, that you can open their hearts that they can receive what you’re giving to them.<br><br>But it all depends on God, all we have to do is serve, what we have to do is just to teach. So that doesn’t worry me that much. Because if the person is to accept what God is bringing to them, they will accept it. And if they are hardened, their hearts will not receive what God is bringing to them. I believe there will be a time when they will change and accept the true doctrine of the gospel.",Are there any things you’re thankful for about CAPA?,"I remember telling my mom and sister and brother that only this week when I did studies at CAPA, I already feel the change. And I believe God is doing something very great with the things in my life and even the friends that we’re taking the classes together. I feel at the end of the year, we will not be the same. God is equipping us to be something that is great, I know. Because just at the end of three weeks I see that we are learning from people like Pastor Thomas who is teaching hermeneutics. The things that he’s teaching us, I do appreciate. There are things that we cannot know on [right now]. We can read, but we cannot really understand the meaning of the whole text [without these classes]. The way they are teaching the classes is so great.",Do you have any prayer requests?,"I really need God’s direction in terms of what I am doing after CAPA. Help me pray for a vision and the opportunity that God is creating for me to serve him right after my studies here. That’s the best thing.<br><br>One thing that I don’t want to do in life is that I find myself in a place where that I have gone there for my own purposes, not to serve Christ but maybe for my own benefits. I want to serve Christ. I want to be in a place where God is the one calling me there. I don’t want to miss it. Please pray that God will take me to a place that he wants me to be.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How did you come to trust in Jesus as your Lord and Savior?,"I came to know Christ when a pastor who came to our place. That time I was living in the village, then he preached a message from the book of 2 Kings. So that really touched my heart and when I went home, I was just like meditating on what he preached on and that night I really struggled and compared my spiritual life. I was convicted, feeling guilty of what I was doing, I had no relationship with God. Because in the first place I was one of those people who believed that God is for the westerners, so I thought that. But when I first got the message, the clear message I realized I needed this Jesus to save my life. So I prayed that night and felt like light in my heart.",What particular message from 2 Kings?,"It was 2 Kings 5. It was about Naaman, how he got healed and after he got healed, he acknowledged that there is no God but the God of Israel. So the preacher emphasized on the people who still want to keep their sins without repenting because they don’t know the true God. So when I came to know this true God, I believed him.",Why did you decide to become a pastor?,"Honestly, I never, ever desired to be a pastor. I wanted to be a businessman. So in 2000, because I believed in Jesus in 1999, in 2000 after I was finishing my high school, I was working with a Presbyterian church. And there we were doing a lot of preaching. But I still wanted to be a businessman and help people who are pastors. <br><br>Then later in 2001, I was involved in a ministry to do with children and youth. And then the passion, I started like, it was like just coming and it was something new, but I said I don’t want it, I don’t want to be a pastor.<br><br>Then we had the youth group and the young people were coming, and later there was no church, so we used to meet and people said, “Can you be our pastor?” And I said, “No, I don’t want to be a pastor.” We could not find anybody, and at the same time, I started developing the willingness to be the pastor. But on the one hand, “I don’t want this one,” but I was also willing.<br><br>Then later, we started a church that was called Hope Community Church. I started it. There was no church at the place I was ministering. It was like a ministry but without a church. So every week, weekdays, we would going out preaching, but then people were not instructed where to go because even the places had no churches. The only church we called African Abraham, and this church believes in polygamy. So if we preach to a person and we tell them to go to this church, this church is a polygamist church, so it was contradicting the message. So people said, “Please just start.” So we started this church and we pastor it.",Why did you decide to attend CAPA?,"Because I never attended any theological training or pastoral ministry, I was just kind of reading books, some of the books were like biased in some theological things and with the popularity of the prosperity message, these are the books that were exposed to me. And I was wondering whether I’m really a pastor or not. Because when I try to compare my life, my ministry with the ministry of others, I was like, “What is real, what is real?” So in between this like misunderstanding, I heard from Gideon Manda, who is the Dean of [Students], that there is a school, if you apply, just check on the beliefs and the statement of faith. So I got the statement of faith and I read it and said, “This is the school.”<br><br>Another thing I like of CAPA when I read it in the paper, is that they offer, they invite students for two weeks, then after two weeks they go. Because I never wanted to study in seminary that would exclude my work ministry to do just studying at the same time. So I wanted to study and go back to the ministry, so I’m not like most, I’m connected and that’s what I wanted. But I did not find this type of school. And when I found it, I said, “Wow, This is exactly what I wanted.” <br><br>So the first day I checked, I said, “Wow.” I explained to my wife, I explained to the church, and everybody said, “We’ll pay for you. This is good. This is good.” So the people like it very much.<br><br>And I had confirmation, after Manda, there was also a pastor, who was a Presbyterian working together in the children’s ministry. He said, “Do you know CAPA? Have you heard about CAPA?” I said, “What about CAPA?” He said, “They are good lectures.” I said, “They haven’t started, why are you calling them good? School starts in summer but this is somewhere June, why are you saying they’re good?” He said, “I know this is going to be good. Please apply.” I said, “I’ve already applied.” He said, “Why didn’t you tell me, I wanted to support you!” I said, “It’s OK, we can manage.” So this person also confirmed that this is a good school. And then I came. And when I came there was no difference with what I heard in comparison with what I was learning. It really shaped my thinking.",What are your future ministry plans?,"I will stay because we are planting more churches in the outskirt of the city and also in other districts. So my goal is to get more people into training starting from the diploma level while we are growing and seeing ourselves ministering to many different people.<br><br>I also wish to have a Chichewa Bible school in my church, that will train local pastors who cannot manage to attend this training at CAPA because here they are done in English. Those who are gifted but they have no opportunity to go to school. With their level of education, they cannot manage to come and study at CAPA. So I want to have a, after this, a training station of leaders so my role is always to be training leaders while sending more preachers to come cause we are planting many churches.",What are some things about CAPA you’re thankful for?,"I thank God that I’m part of this CAPA family. I started with the diploma. I graduated, and by the grace of God, I am also taken to study the Master of Divinity. This to me is a fulfillment, I think, of fulfilling what God wants me to do while I’m still living. So I really like it very, very much. And my church.<br><br>One other thing I like about CAPA is after I’ve done the diploma course, the standard of preaching has changed. The standard has been raised and that has brought the fear not just on the pulpit but on God. But all this is because God channeled my life to be part of the training system of CAPA.",Any prayer requests you’d like to share?,"My prayer request is that these days, we have a lot of influences from political parties, especially this side. My prayer is that, pray for grace that God’s grace will always keep me unique, not unique that I’m a spiritual something, but unique in terms of standing firm in the faith without going back or diverting from the truth. <br><br>For me I started this church by God’s grace, but it is Jesus who started it through me, and I want to keep it reminded that it is God who started it, I don’t want to take it for my personal attestation and personal gain. Because I’ve seen this is happening, and I don’t want this to happen in my life and also in my church even if I’m gone. I want those who come after me to continue the vision that God has given us in preaching the Word of God.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Maybe in therms of food, or...?<br><br><i>Anything you want!<br><br>[<i>laughs</i>]Okay. Ah, usually… I don’t know. But, as a family… I do love much to be with my wife, to chat with my wife. And when we have some free time, yeah sometimes we do go together, swimming in the lake. I am coming from Mzuzu, but sometimes we do go to Lake Malawi.<br><br>But also, I love serving with the youth. I love teaching the youth. I’m still a young pastor—I’m still in that age of youth, so I do like serving these, helping the youth learn that they should know God, and they should also walk in the life of godly.<br><br> In terms of sports, I do like soccer. That is my favorite sport activity.<br><br><i>Do you have a favorite food?</i><br><br>I do like...rice and chicken.<br><br><i>I had that yesterday!</i><br><br>Yes, so yesterday was my day.<i>[<i>laughs</i>]</i>",How did you first hear about Jesus and come to believe that Jesus died for your sins?,"Well, it was the time when I was at secondary school. At the first place, I was not born in a family that… feared God very much… so, but, by the grace of God I started going to church, accompanying my friends who were coming from God-fearing families, so I went to church. Then when my parents saw that I was going to church and everything was okay then my parents started following me. But in fact, by then, I did not receive Jesus as my Lord. So it was when I was at secondary school, because at first, when I was going to these churches, I was just feeling something like I was not satisfied— like, maybe there was something that was missing.<br><br>So when I was yet at secondary school, there was a certain group of people from a student Christian organization. These guys came to our school and they preached very well and I was convicted that you know… they taught us about Jesus, that no you have to receive Jesus as Lord and Savior of your life.<br><br>Now I saw that in fact, I’ve been going to church, but… this teaching seems to be new to me, and… it makes sense to me. After they preached they had an altar call, so I was one of the people who went in the front to be helped to receive Jesus as Lord and Savior. So, that is how I received the Lord Jesus Christ.",What is your current ministry?,"I am pastoring in Living Christian Church, which is northeast of this district of Lilongwe. Of course the headquarters are right behind this building [points to the building in front], so that is the headquarters, but it is also found in southern regions.<br><br>For example, just last year I was ministering in Blantyre, and I was transferred to come here because there is a Bible school at the headquarters and also I am one of the lecturers there.",How did you come to CAPA then?,"I just heard people talking about CAPA when it was about to open. So then I tried to find out and I was impressed, especially when I heard about expository preaching, because I heard that this type of preaching is different from other methods of preaching because it… it allows the Bible to speak for itself. So I was interested, no, no, this is what I have been looking for. It was when I applied and I was called in, and I did my Advanced Diploma here.<br><br>When I came to CAPA, even before my graduation, whatever message I planned to preach, that was topical in nature or whatsoever sermon I had prepared I did not preach it—but the only method I accepted, “This is the right method of preaching” was expository preaching. So from that time I started expository preaching, and I am preaching expository sermons and they are very good, sermons.<br><br>Yes, my church is very convinced with this type of preaching and also appreciates what CAPA is doing. And in appreciation for this, this year, it has managed to send three other students here, and they are doing their diploma program.",How about in the future? What are your future ministry plans?,"Well, as for the future, in fact, we are planning to [plant] more churches to reach where the message of Jesus Christ has not been preached. But to do that, we need reliable people who have gone through CAPA, or who know how to preach expository sermons and things like that. So the vision is there, that we want to reach out to unreached places, but these people should go through CAPA so that they should be well-equipped for ministry.<br><br><i>So you want to plan churches in unreached places?</i><br><br>Yes, yes.<br><br><i>What areas are you thinking of, maybe?</i><br><br>In villages inside and outside of Malawi, yeah. So something like maybe 3 or 4 years to come we are opening a branch in South Africa. So in fact we just send someone to be there, but one of the guys that are here, they will be sent there, yeah.","After applying and practicing expository preaching, have you seen spiritual growth in your church?","Yes, because with expository preaching, it’s not the pastor who is preaching, but the Bible! God Himself speaks to the people. Unlike with other types of preaching where the pastor needs to be a clever person who knows how to twist words and whatnot, this time I can see spiritual growth because the Bible speaks for itself to the people.<br><br><i>How can you see the change in people?</i><br><br>In fact, spiritual growth can be seen in a number of areas. For example, the way how they love to read the Bible. You see, with the other types of preachings, we just… read the Bible once, then you just explain things which you call revelations, so the Bible is left somewhere there and the pastor is there jumping with a microphone! [<i>laughs</i>]<br><br>But with expository preaching, you say, “Please, let’s go to this verse.” Then after that, after explaining you say, “Let’s go to another verse”—so, so people see what the pastor is saying is what is in the Scriptures, so people love to hear what the Scripture says than what the pastor is just saying. So people like their Bibles and read their Bibles.<br><br>And also there is also spiritual growth in the way that people conduct themselves, see—and in terms of things like discipline issues. So I can see that issues to do with discipline have become minimal. And like in the past year when there were so many cases like, “Oh this one has left his wife, oh this one has committed adultery, oh this person has done this,” but this time I can see that there is change because they hear the Bible speaking to the people, so as the Lord Himself said, “I will bless my Word.”<br><br>So after preaching expository preaching, God Himself is blessing His Word, unlike those odd methods where a pastor is just speaking something that is coming from his mind.",What are some ways we can be praying for you?,"1)One of the things which you can assist me when you are praying is to pray for my ministry, so that my ministry can achieve the goals that are there to reach out to the people that have not been reached with the gospel.<br><br>2)And even my studies here, we are studying Greek, so it’s hard! [<i>laughs</i>] It’s hard to catch up with it, it’s not simple! So you can as well help me.<br><br>3) And also, you can also pray for this school CAPA—we want this school to, it should not just come here to… to pass, but it should be here forever! It should come here to stay, not just to pass by.",What is your favorite thing about Malawi?,"Mm, my favorite thing about Malawi is that it is a peaceful country and so you can preach the word of God freely. You can go any place and preach the word of God. And unlike other countries, when problems are there when a pastor, when a minister of god wants to preach he can be persecuted, all those thing happen. But here in Malawi, you know, one thing which I like about Malawi is our freedom of worship and the peace that is existing in this country.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When I read the Bible, one time I was reading the Bible, Matthew 9, verse 35, where the Bible says that Jesus went about preaching in the cities and synagogues and he looked at the people and they were like sheep scattered without a shepherd, and He said to pray to the lord of the harvest because the harvest is plenty but the workers are few.<br><br>When I read that Scripture, it struck my heart, and like God was speaking to me that the workers are few but the harvest is plenty and I want you to be one of the workers.

I have the responsibility most of the Sundays it is me preaching.",What are your future ministry plans?,"The thing is, even as of now, I preach at that local church, we call it Living Waters Church.<br><br>I have another ministry also, which we call the Healing of the Nations. This ministry will focuses on emotional healing, spiritual healing, and we are also talking about the healing of the nations, the healing of families.<br><br>I believe that apart from the local church ministry, I want to take the ministry maybe on a broader perspective whereby maybe I can reach a larger group of people and help them out. And this Healing of the Nations is not just a local ministry, denominational thing, but it’s interdenominational, so yeah. I feel that through that also we can help a lot.<br><br>Currently, we just started this year, so I can’t say we haven’t gone to any country, but it’s our dream to impact other nations—so wherever the Lord will lead us, we will go.",What are challenges you have faced in ministry?,"As you know, in Ephesians 6 verse 12, it says that we wrestle not against flesh and blood. So every time you are ministering, there is an enemy who is there, so there is some sort of resistance. Sometimes that resistance can come through members, sometimes they are people that resist your vision. It’s like they don’t understand your vision. There may be some who want to undermine your calling. They can create stories, things like those.<br><br>Also I remember in 2003, I got an attack of tuberculosis, I was down, I thought I was going to die. In 2005 again, it happened the same. [<i>laughs</i>] But through the grace of God, I am still strong and here I am—I am still preaching the Word!",What have you learned from those challenges?,"Mainly from the sickness, I’ve learned that God allows things in our lives sometimes so that we may have another understanding about Him, and sometimes also it helps to grow our faith, because without challenges, our faith cannot grow. That’s why I believe the Bible says to consider it all joy when you go through trials.<br><br>Through that, it also has helped me to minister to those people that are having similar problems or sicknesses. And now, when I’m ministering to those people, I find that I am ministering to them on a deeper level than I did when I didn’t have that attack.<br><br>The other thing is that I talked also that maybe some people don’t understand your vision—you always have people that try to sidetrack you. But you have to be focused and maintain your focus. But also sometimes, you have to be careful when you are listening to the people who criticize you. Sometimes they may be saying something that is true. So you just have to be a genius, take what is helpful and throw away which is ill-motives.",How did you first hear about Jesus? How did you come to believe that Jesus died for your sins?,"I can say since my parents were Presbyterian members, but they were nominal members, not born again. From my childhood, I used to go to church, but I didn’t have a personal relationship. But this day that I’m talking about, it’s when now I know that Jesus Christ came into my heart and I became born again.<br><br>In that same state when I said I was depressed, after my father, then there was another brother who started talking to me about Jesus. So I got more open to the Word because of the state that I was in. One of the days, he took me to preaching, it was just in a house.<br><br>When he was preaching, I can remember he quoted Romans 10, verses 9-10, at the end, where he says, “If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved.” That is the only verse that I can remember out of the whole sermon! And he said, “Some of you people go to church, but you haven’t made a special commitment to God by inviting Jesus to come into your heart. So if you can’t invite him in your heart, you can’t be born again, you cannot have eternal life.”<br><br>So when he made an altar call, I felt something pulling me to go forward. Now I know it was not something, but I know it was the Holy Spirit. So I went forward, he led me into the prayer of receiving Jesus. So I was convinced through the preaching of the Word, that Jesus came to die for me.",What’s your favorite thing about Malawi?,"My favorite thing about Malawi? Mm… people. [<i>laughs</i>] As a preacher, my favorite thing about Malawi is people. When I look at people, I see the work of God, and I see that God wants to change them.<br><br>For example, if someone takes me to a stadium, some people just look at the football, but when I’m there, I’m looking at the people, if these people can receive Jesus, if I can have a chance of filling the stadium like this and influence these people to Jesus, then I think that will bring glory to God. So, people, yeah, sure. [<i>laughs</i>]",What prayer requests do you have?,"1) Pray for my family, that we all need to be strong in the Lord, because a healthy family leads also into a powerful ministry, so pray for us that we continue being strong in the Lord.<br><br>2) For clarity of vision, and that God will continue giving us the energy and the strength to take the gospel to where He wants us to take it.<br><br>3) Pray for Malawi, that the Christians in Malawi will be serious. Sometimes, I find that there is some laxity, sometimes we Christians in Malawi are not committed as we are supposed to be. So I think there is a need of seriousness and commitment so that the revival may spread across Malawi",What are some things about CAPA that you are thankful for?,"I should really say that the staff that we are getting here is excellent. It’s so helpful for ministry. One of the things is that you go to many Bible schools, and you wonder if these things that they are teaching me are really going to be helpful on the ground? But here, we can really see that what we are being taught is really going to help us in the ministry. <br><br>But also, it’s not only the staff, but they have also given us resources, like books, which means that even when I am not in the classroom, I’m at home, I’ve got something to read, to study, so that is so helpful.",,,,,,,,,,,,

What is one thing you hope to learn at CAPA?,"When CAPA came, I felt like I needed to learn more about the Bible, because I teach the Bible, so I need to have a full understanding of the Bible, then I can deliver the right stuff. I don’t just teach the children, when I train the children workers, I teach them how to use the Bible. <br><br>I hope to learn how to dig out the Word, how to interpret that Word, find the real meaning of the Word. So many times we read the Word and we think, “I think it’s talking about this.” When really, it’s not talking about that. So I expect to learn exactly what exactly the Word is saying and how does that apply to me as a teacher, and how does that apply to the children. I expect to learn how to deliver the Word of God.",What is your current ministry? What are your future ministry plans?,"Yeah, I teach children everyday at school. <br><br>In the future, I think I will help the churches who have Sunday School, children’s ministry. I will groom their teachers, because a lot of people, when they talk about children’s ministry, it’s kind of like babysitting. A lot of people have that type of mentality, to get the children out of the church so people could take care of them. No, that’s not children ministry. You teach them when you are at the house. The Lord trusted the lives of the children to you so you don’t play around with their lives. You empower the Word of God in their lives. I will model the children workers. I will challenge the churches what to do with their children’s ministry.","What are challenges you’ve faced in ministry, and what have you learned from them?","This ministry, you work with different kinds of churches that have different beliefs. When you go in organizations that deal with children, they have different religions, and when you tell them about the Word, they go, “My religion doesn’t go like this.” I have to find a proper way how to tell them about the Word. What I’ve been trying to improve on is character development. I tell them, “Well, let’s develop a right character in the children.” Like doing the right thing, not doing the wrong thing. In saying this, I run away from telling them what the Bible says, and while they ask me to teach them the right character, then I teach them examples of who the right characters or who to learn from, then I go to the Bible. That’s why I really need to learn more. <br><br>I have learned to be patient. People speak in a harsh way, and if you’re not patient, you get frustrated and stuck. If you are patient, you keep going back to them, and say, “Come on, let’s work together.” Although you’re receiving punches, you go, “Let’s work together” and endure.",How did you first hear about Jesus? How did you come to believe He died for your sins?,"My dad, he was a Christian. And he taught me from my childhood how to believe in Jesus.When I grew up in the Christian home, it was like, this is the way to go. Not really for me, but this is how it is. In 1987, I asked Jesus to come into my heart. I said, “Jesus, occupy my heart.” From that day I asked Jesus into my heart, the encouragement I was getting from my dad was that “the Jesus that is in you, you need to nurture Him. The only way to nurture Him is by praying, reading the Word, and fellowshipping with people.”",What is your favorite thing about Malawi?,"The fresh water from the lake. That’s special about Malawi. The peace that we have from this country. I’ve traveled to other countries and found out it’s not as peaceful as it is here. I didn’t know that people here are friendly ‘til I went to other countries. I’ve been to America. We were taught, “Don’t just talk to anyone, don’t just greet anyone.” Over here, when you’re walking on the street, if there is something coming from your direction, you can greet them. That’s special about Malawi.",What is one of your favorite verses and why?,"Joshua 1:8. At the end it says, “So that you can do accordingly.” So you can do everything written in the Word. If you go without meditating on the Word, you can do only some things. But if you meditate on the Word, you will do it. Other things that seem to be tough, you can do it.",What are ways we can be praying for you?,"I’d like to learn more. Please help me to learn more even if I get knowledge from here, I’d like to learn even more, advance myself. And my children. I’d love to see them serving God. If you are praying, pray for my future, pray for my children, so that they can grow loving God. My first born girl, she’s becoming a youth now, and youth sometimes they go wild. I just want God’s favor on them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because they are more focused on that, I am going to get the knowledge I will be able to use when I am in ministry.<br><br>CAPA has experienced lecturers, and the other thing is that CAPA has reasonable fees that even we, who do not have much money, are able to participate in training, so that is helpful to us as the local people in the country.

So verse 16 emphasizes that as Christians, we should do good things to other people so in return, they should praise the name of God. So yes, that was the message that I was preaching on Sunday.",What are your future ministry plans?,"I leave everything in the hands of God—people have got a lot to plan, but God is the one who will implement that. When I graduate from CAPA here, I will go for further education. My aim is to become a full minister, and if there is the opportunity, to do a Ph.D program. I hope that CAPA will provide that. I would be very interested.","What are challenges you have faced in ministry, and what have you learned from them?","Right. There are several challenges that we face within ministry.<br><br>Sometimes it is the cultural backgrounds of the people, because Christianity came later after the people had their traditional religions, so sometimes you try to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ and people pretend that they are really now converted, but you see that they are still going for other practices or traditional things.<br><br>Sometimes people do not put things into practice because of things that they are going through. The lessons that I have taken are that you have to be persistent and consistent no matter the challenges. You have to push on to achieve what you want to achieve, especially in preaching the good message of God.",How did you first hear about Jesus? How did you come to believe that Jesus died for your sins?,"That is a very interesting question. [<i>laughs</i>] I was brought up in a family of believers, so yes, my parents taught me, but I came to be convicted when I was in secondary school in a service by a preacher from Zimbabwe.<br><br>So he was preaching about how the youth could behave—they believe in God’s word and maybe they go to church, but they don’t practice what they hear from the church. He got that message from Matthew chapter 7, verse 21, which says, “Not all people who say, ‘God, God,’ will have eternal life,” only those people who get that message and put it into practice.<br><br>So from that, I tried to weigh myself: I think that I was maybe just a churchgoer, but why should I be found in the church? It’s not just hearing the Word of God, but hearing the Word of God and putting it into practice.<br><br>So that’s when I came to know Jesus Christ as my personal savior who died for my sins and to redeem my life from the bondage of sin.",What’s your favorite thing about Malawi?,"Oh! Good. [<i>laughs</i>] A favorite about Malawi is the fair citizens, because they have got warm hearts—they are ever smiling, wherever they would go, they have hearts that are flexible, to chat with other people or welcome other people. I like Malawi, and even the nature that God has given us. We have got the lake, we have got the mountains, and we have got the forest, and the national parks, and so I like Malawi.",What prayer requests do you have?,"I would like people to pray for my family.

So great, because you know, CAPA is doing a great thing.<br><br>To be trained, to attend a Master’s in Divinity is not a joke, because we need to cough up a lot of money to go for this. But CAPA is offering that for a reasonable amount.<br><br>Frankly speaking, it is almost for free, because we are talking about food, accommodation.

Resources materially, financially, all aspects of resources—we need that to preach the gospel.<br><br>3) And also to be able to take care of our families so that as we take care of our families, we can move on—we can go out to preach the gospel while the families are well-taken care of.

Are you willing?” I said, “Yeah, why not? This is what I’m looking for.” So he gave me some forms, I read them, I filled the forms, and submitted.

I have to come to CAPA and pursue my studies, so I am glad.",What is your current ministry?,"I like hospital ministry. Yeah, especially weekends, I do go to the hospitals, interact with the patients, pray with them, share with them the word of God. I like people receiving Christ, especially those who run away from us when they are free. I meet them there in the hospital. I like the ministry.<br><br>With the patients: one, I encourage them, or I talk more about salvation of the soul. And I talk about why do people got sick.

That church is where I will bring all these ministries together, elderly ministry, the youth ministry, yes, as one church.","What are challenges you’ve faced in ministry, and what have you learned from them?","Yeah, it’s a good question. There are really challenges, especially when you are under someone. Because in the Spirit, you see differently. If I see a youth ministry, the older pastor might not see a youth ministry.<br><br>So when you approach each other, most of the time, the senior pastor will say, “No, no, no. Stop this. Listen to what I’m saying. I am in charge of this place.” It becomes a hiccup in the calling.<br><br>I have realized or learned that when you are under somebody, always we have to humble ourselves, and wait for the time of God.

But if, and I can see that CAPA is falling into that channel of focusing on pastors, that they can as well, go with the message, train other pastors. That is brilliant for me.

And if they continue doing this, giving more chance to the pastors who are already in the ministry but they are lacking trainings like this one.<br><br>I think God will bless CAPA.

So in 2008, is when I joined this pastoral ministry.<br><br>The first thing which I thought is like… I started loving ministry. Because I started preaching and serving God when I was still at high school, that is, in form 2.

Not that great.<br><br><i>How did you write your sermons?</i><br><br>Yeah, most of the time, like when I was just beginning preaching, I was troubled. I was asking usually people who were already preaching: “How do you know that this is the message God wants?” But many of them it seems like, they didn’t have any [ideas on] how to preach because also they were preaching without going to school, so there was no any specific way on how you can preach.<br><br> So it was like, ah, maybe if you hear someone preaching and that message has convicted you, then you take that message, and sometimes when you are just going through the Bible and you are studying the Bible you feel, “Ah!

There will be no service today because the pastor is out.” They will not even understand the word of God.<br><br>But now, I appreciate because some of the members, they are showing spiritual maturity, and some of them they are showing that they are growing. At first they were only depending upon me, but now they can go and read the Bible and actually understand the Bible, and I know some of them, they can really stand and also they can preach.<br><br><i>Can you think of an example recently in which you see the fruit of the Spirit in someone’s life?</i><br><br>Yeah, ah, a good example, is… at first, as I’ve already started to say, some of the members were failing to preach, and to teach, and also some of the members had a lot of conflict in their families.<br><br>And also one of my members, I remember he was a drunkard. But now when, he was even hiding from me, but now after coming here, I sat with him, trying to explain the Word to him, trying to teach… I found that he is one of the leading factors in the change. He is the person now who is now trying to say, “Pastor, I’m really changed.” He’s able to lead his family well, and he has stopped all… he’s no longer taking alcohol whatsoever, his life is one of the models to see. Yeah, directed him in God’s word.<br><br>And also we have some Bible studies… like this time we are teaching them about marriage issues, how can a Christian marriage be. So that also has helped some of the members to have a good marriage in their family.",What are your future ministry plans?,"My plan for future ministry… for me, I’m serving at a village, where there are very few people, they have, they are exposed to the truth from the Bible. And then we have some pastors who are there, but I feel pity because they are not handling the word of God the way they are supposed to be. So I feel like, if God would allow me whatever I’m obtaining here, what I’m receiving from this CAPA, I should also able to go and teach the people.<br><br>So my plan is, I should be a pastor, serving the church—at the same time, also I should, maybe I should have like a training school, seminars whereby I can gather these leaders, church leaders and maybe some pastors, and also can give them some teaching, because I know that it’s not all of them who can have access coming at CAPA. But what I have received from here, I should also go and impart and also preach and also teach some of the people who can also able to teach.<br><br>So my big plan, my vision is, if possible, I can have like, organize school, training school like that, so I am also able to teach the guys. Because in village, especially here in Malawi, in village, people, they don’t know the truth. I don’t know, maybe in towns, but in village, people don’t know the truth. So I really, I have that passion for the people in the village. So I need to be committed and serve the Lord.<br><br><i>Are you from the vilage yourself?</i><br><br>I'm from there! It's where I'm staying.","In your seven years in ministry, what are some challenges you have faced, and what has God taught you through the challenges?","Ah… the most great thing which God has taught me through the challenges which I have come across, is like always, we need to depend upon Him. And always, we need to trust Him, no matter how tough it goes.<br><br>Ah, and also, whenever we try to shift our focus from God, and we focus maybe on other people, we focus on other things… our life spiritual also goes down. And God always need that, as we are serving Him, always, we need to depend upon Him, 100%, always need to trust Him and always we need to see Him!<br><br>Because there is a time when, I do go into tough time, and tough situation, and sometimes I do think of people say “Ah! Maybe go to such person, and such person maybe will help me and will come.” But even those people you think that are going to help, sometimes they disappoint you. Even maybe some of the people whom you do think, “Ah! I think that guy, if I will explain my situation, he will maybe will comfort me,” and the very same person will maybe bring some pain in your life.<br><br>So through these situations, all that I have come across, it’s like ah! I think God is [teaching us] that we need to depend upon Him always. And also He need that [if] we have maybe successful life, we need to bring glory to Him. All this happen because of God Himself.<br><br><i>In your ministry, what do you think are the most difficult challenges?</i><br><br>For me, ah, the greatest challenge… you come a time, when you are committed to serve the Lord, but you find that… maybe you don’t have the… all the necessities, all the materials, and skills.<br><br>And also you find that even the people whom you are serving—they are not responding to the word of God. And you find that you are trying your ever best to say, “Ah! I think this is what I’m doing,” but you find that the people, they are responding negatively. So it becomes a little bit tough, you say, “What can I do?”<br><br> Also as I’ve said say, maybe you are committed to serve, but you don’t have the material. You don’t have the tools to use when you are serving—it’s also a little bit, difficult. Like, you find that in a church, even the people cannot even manage to have Bibles.<br><br>And even yourself as a pastor, because… as you are preaching, [you] really depend that God will going to… to give that support. You find that in the village, you live in a situation whereby… you don’t know who support you! Because you know that, ah! I am going to get this support from these members, because I am serving them spiritually, so they need to support me physically.<br><br>But! Those members, whom you are depending upon or you are… expecting that they are going to support you, they also seeking support from you, physically. So it becomes a little bit, difficult, and, yeah.<br><br>Sometimes you find that you can be committed, but… because maybe you have a family also, you need to be… to be supported, it’s very easy for you to be a half-time pastor. And you can be committed to serve the Lord, and also you have another work to do, so that maybe you can, I can support my family.<br><br>At the moment you do that, you find that… your life is… you are not really 100% committed to serve the Lord. Yeah, so it’s like, you are trying this another hand, and also you have ministry in another hand… ah. So it’s become tough.",How did you come to believe that Jesus died for your sins?,"Ah, for me… I was brought up by my grandparents. And my grandparents, my grandmother is the one who was… I can’t call she was a believer, but she was a regular church member. So I can say I was born in a family, I was brought up in a family whereby they were not Christians.<br><br>But we were going to church. [<i>laughs</i>] We were going to church mostly every Sunday. Yeah, our grandmother was teaching us some of the insights about God’s way, but not about salvation.<br><br>But now when I was in… we call it standard 8, there was a group of missionaries who came in our village. They were calling it… ahh… “Gideon”? Is it “Gideon”, or “gospel”? Or whatsoever. They came there with, they had an open-air to do evangelism, so during the day they came at our home and preached the Word, and also they invited us to go for open-air meeting.<br><br>So I went there, ah, that was in the evening. So, because I was going to this church which my grandmother was also going, but they were not teaching about salvation, and there was no issue about the love of God whatsoever.<br><br>But when I attended this, I remember they preached about… about sin! The wages of sin, it was like, I was like “Oh! It means… I will die.” Yeah, because I was doing all these things and I was committing things and I was like “Ah! But then, how can I have hope?”<br><br>But when they preached about the love of God, and about Jesus Christ who came and died for us, and through Him we can find the way, and through Him we can be forgiven, it’s like, my heart was burning, and “I think I need this Jesus.” <br><br>And when they invited the altar call, say “Those who want to come, who want to receive Christ, they need to come in front,” I would not wait! I went there, at right moment, and they led us in a confession prayer, and I prayed, and… from that I changed [churches].<br><br>I moved from the church which my grandmother was, we were going, and I joined Baptist church. Yeah, so I joined… I received Christ, that was in… 1999. It’s when I received Christ to be my Lord and Savior.<br><br>And from that time, my grandmother was not happy, because I changed the church. But later on, when she… she started observing some changes in my life, and she said, “Ah! I think now you are changing.” Because, some of the things which I was doing which was not… maybe sometime I was ignoring my parents and I was not obeying them, they started observing some changes, that’s when they said, “Ah! I think you are really changed.” And from that time is when I believe God has really transformed me.",How can we be praying for you?,"1)Ah… first of all, I think the great thing which you can pray for me is like… I need to be committed. To serve the Lord. And also I need to be faithful to the Lord, no matter how tough, or no matter how [successful] I should be, but I should always be faithful.<br><br>2)And also, you need to pray for me especially, as I am sad to say… that sometimes we lack support. We can be committed to serve the Lord, but to find that physically, you have some challenges. So… I think God that should open some doors, and should bring some means of how can be supported, so that I am able to—if we are able to find these fees? who need, and also should be able to preach well, yeah.<br><br>3)And also, I think also you need to pray for my church, so that the members should grow spiritually, as well as the gospel should be extended to all the people in the village. Because the village which I am coming from, the gospel is… yes, people are there and they are preaching, but… most of them, they are not preaching the gospel, because they do not know it—they don’t have knowledge. So I think… you need to pray for me that I should bring the gospel to many people.<br><br>4)And also that my vision should come true. By the end of the day, I need - I should see that, I think I am training other people so that also they may able to know the word of God.",What is your favorite thing about Malawi?,"Ah, my favorite thing? Maybe in therms of food, or...?<br><br><i>Anything you want!<br><br>[<i>laughs</i>]</i>Okay. Ah, usually… I don’t know. But, as a family… I do love much to be with my wife, to chat with my wife. And when we have some free time, yeah sometimes we do go together, swimming in the lake. I am coming from Mzuzu, but sometimes we do go to Lake Malawi.<br><br>But also, I love serving with the youth. I love teaching the youth. I’m still a young pastor—I’m still in that age of youth, so I do like serving these, helping the youth learn that they should know God, and they should also walk in the life of godly.<br><br> In terms of sports, I do like soccer.

I want to see how good this God is, I want just to serve Him.” But I didn’t want to be a pastor. The reasoning was that I didn’t want to be a poor person.” [<i>laughs</i>] But then when I, as time went on and I graduated from high school, and then as I was visiting different churches, I could listen to the sermons that were being preached, and looking at the group in the church, I could see that there was something else missing. That someone was not being faithful in preaching the Word. And I was always having a lot of questions, I was always criticizing them like, “No, that’s not what the Bible said.” And I didn’t have any training. <br><br>So, by the grace of God, the Lord opened the door for me to go and attend Christ Seminary in South Africa. And when I graduated there, I really wanted to be a pastor. I really wanted to preach; mainly because here in Malawi, there is a lot of compromising. Pastors are compromising the truth.

You know, “name it, claim it”? We only stress on preaching the Word. For people to understand that, it’s a big challenge, especially for our members. The biggest challenge is attracting people to our church and I believe that with time, the Lord will use my faithful preaching to reach out to the people. He will send us the people that need to come our church. We trust that if the Lord wants this planted in the city of Lilongwe, He’s going to carry us through. <br><br>I’ve learned to trust the Lord. Previously, I was trusting people. When I see someone from America, I would say, “Here is my help. Here is my answer to all the challenges that I’ve been facing.” I have been disappointed for that.

So when I went to school, some guy came to preach at the graduation. He preached on John 3:16. He taught us that God loved the world, and He gave His only begotten Son. And to just look at that, and think about that, that somebody died. That was a revelation to me, that was new to me, that someone could die for me. And His name is Jesus and that if I believe in Him, I’m not going to die. <br><br>He was pointing at all angles. One of the angles I was sitting. And he was saying, “Some of you, you don’t know about Jesus. This might be your last chance.” And mind you, my dad had just died, and I didn’t want to die.

Someone led me to Christ, and I professed Him as my Lord and Savior.",What is your favorite thing about Malawi?,"[<i>laughs</i>]] Malawi’s good, Malawi’s cool. We’re in the heart of Africa. It’s a good place because missionaries from all over the world come and evangelize, and teach people about God. We have lakes and mountains, one of my favorites to see in this nation.",What is one of your favorite verses and why?,"One of my favorite verses is 2 Corinthians 5:17. Another one is 2 Corinthians 5:14. Now I am a Christian, I no longer live for myself. I live for Jesus who died for me. I like those verses because they show me my identity in Him, that before, I was a sinner. Now because I have received Him, Christ does not count my sins. I will not walk in former condemnation. Christ must be my Lord, and He should control my life.",What are ways we can be praying for you?,"Pray for me for the guidance of the Lord in my future for ministry. Pray that the Lord should open doors, whether it’s financial doors, so that I could proceed to do school.

But also when I look at the church I attended, there was a need. I needed to make a huge decision and I left my work to be a pastor. To tell you the truth, it has not been easy. It has not been easy for me. I thank God that up to now I’m still a pastor. <br><br>In the first place, I did accounting and pastoring for 6 months. It was almost impossible. Because you find yourself at work from Monday to Saturday. And then Sunday, you are to be at church and preach. During the week, people need you to be their pastor, to help them. So you find that to balance out the two was difficult for me. But when I decided to not continue work, and to do pastoral work, I have seen tremendous change in my own life, in my church, and with my family. <br><br>I was trained to be an accountant, when I became born again. When I became born again, I had a desire to teach. I had a desire to grow up in the Lord, but I discover that there are very few people that are willing to make me grow up, so I saw a need that somebody needs to be there to help others grow in the Word of God.",Why did you decide to come to CAPA? What is one thing you hope to learn at CAPA?,"The time I became a pastor, in 1997, I didn’t go through formal training, until I pastored a church for two years, and I discovered I have needed to know more of the Word of God. So I began to look for formal training. For the first 3 years, I did basics in theology. But still, there was a need to know more concerning the Word of God. I didn’t do expository preaching, I was a pastor who just wake up in the morning, think what to preach, then look for it in the Scriptures, and if there’s a verse in agreement, then I preach it. <br><br>I want to get to the meaning of the Word. If I let my thoughts go into the Word, then I am in error. But let the Word of God control my thoughts.",What is your current ministry? What are your future ministry plans?,"Currently, I pastor a church, where the membership is about 480 people. So from that church, we have planted other churches. I planted this church, then I oversee others and 2 Bible schools. I discovered there was a need for training, so what was happening was when I went to the first training, I immediately started a school, training people under me. We train pastors for 2 years. <br><br>Currently, I am on the church project. So what we are doing is, we are building a better structure. My future plans is to restructure the church, switching from topical preaching to expository preaching. What I do, is I’m calling back some of our pastors, giving them a training in expository preaching. And then they go back.","What are challenges you’ve faced in ministry, and what have you learned from them?","Another challenge is cultural issues. I am preaching where it’s a set up of educated people and uneducated people. Some are blessed with resources, others are not. The challenge is in leadership. To pastor a church of that size, and to make sure, everyone is pastored. It’s a matter of having people to talk to, touch, and impact their lives in a positive way, so they feel that we have a pastor. I am training other people and separating the church into small church groups. <br><br>I have learned that it takes God’s grace. Like Paul says, “I am what I am, by the grace of God.” Even me coming to this school, I did the diploma class, now I’m in the master’s class. God has given me grace to be at this level. I’ve learned to be consistent. Know what you want to do, and trust God. I define that in 3 angles. I have to know who God is, I have to know who I am, and I have to understand circumstances. Knowing who God is gives me confidence, knowing who I am it gives me limitation [because] there are things I cannot do. And looking at circumstances, I believe that even if I’m not a pastor, I will still face challenges. Facing challenges as a pastor does not mean people are not pastors, everyone face challenges. It’s a part of life. My main focus is to see someone change, to make a decision to give their life to God.",How did you first hear about Jesus? How did you come to believe He died for your sins?,"I grew up in a Christian family, but it was dysfunctional. My father professed to be a Christian but he never lived like a Christian. My mother died when I was young, so I grew up with stepmothers. Growing up with stepmothers affected my Christianity so I stopped going to church. When you grow up in a Christian family, you think you’re already saved, you feel like you’re Christian. But a lot of the times, you’re not. When I went to secondary school, it was when I heard about Jesus. <br><br>In 1993, I decided to give my life to Jesus. When I went to school, there was this girl that I wanted to meet, so she said let’s meet where there was a fellowship. So I go there to check if she’s there, then I would take her outside. So when I got there, I heard someone preaching, from Mark 5, about the compassion of Jesus Christ. So I thought about my background and what I had gone through with my stepmothers, and I listened some more to what she was talking about. The pastor began to talk about the need to know Jesus Christ as your personal Savior and preached about people walking with Jesus, but never experienced the touch of Jesus, except the woman who went and touched Jesus. I was convicted that I needed the touch of Jesus. I was the only one who responded to the altar call, and received Christ. I have followed Christ from that day.",What is your favorite thing about Malawi?,"There are two things. Malawians are good people. They are enduring people. We have gone through issues, but Malawians are still good people. Every night, we gather around the fire, and the elders tell us stories.<br><br>Number two, I like the geographical position of Malawi. If you have an opportunity to travel, you’ll see the uniqueness of Malawi. To the north, it’s full of mountains. Center, it’s a plane. South, it’s a valley. It’s a beautiful country.",What is one of your favorite verses and why?,"Colossians 2:20. “The life I live in the flesh, Christ lives through me.” It does not matter about me, what matters now is about Christ. I have to live for Christ.",What are ways we can be praying for you?,"I have one prayer request which is that God would open up a door in Malawi that the Word of God will be preached in truth. If you move around to ask people, their life does not match their conduct. I want to teach the Word of God. That’s why I love CAPA. It acts like a tool which helps us. CAPA is not the only Bible school, but they help you to go through the word. If you can pray for me, please pray that God will use me as a tool to help, and to be used to bring out the meaning of the word to the Bible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior to being a pastor, I used to witness man to man, leading souls to Christ. I used to preach in market places and prisons, leading souls to Christ. That’s when I came into the full time ministry. Before I thought I wasn’t having ample time to serve the Lord, so I thought like if I give myself to the Lord, that would be a great benefit to Him, as well as to the ministry.",Why did you decide to come to CAPA? What is one thing you hope to learn at CAPA?,"I decided to come to CAPA because of the capacity that CAPA has to produce able people to preach the gospel. It’s such a great opportunity because people travel to the States, and to the UK, to other countries, to learn ministry, but 80% of those who go abroad to learn to minister, they never come back. So the nation, Africa at large, doesn’t benefit. So when I learn that CAPA is here, the same stuff that people learn in the States, I thought it was a great blessing. So instead of traveling all the way to the States, and having the temptation to not come back, it would be such a great honor and opportunity to learn here, and be of a blessing to the people in Africa here. <br><br>One of the things I would really love to learn is Greek and Hebrew. These are the things I have been desiring, and it is an opportunity to learn, we have already studied learning, and I know it’s hard. It take commitment and dedication but God will give us the grace to understand the Bible and to preach it as it is through Greek and Hebrew.",What is your current ministry? What are your future ministry plans?,"It is based here in Lilongwe. So far we have planted over 50 churches and so the ministry is growing. It is at the rightful time to be taught so I can become a better preacher. I’m the founding pastor, overseer. <br><br>My future ministry plan is to evangelize globally beginning in Malawi, we have a population of 17 million people and those souls have never been reached. Most of these people live in rural areas, so the plan is to train and raise pastors and send them into the rural places and preach the gospel, but again evangelize the globe, in all continents. Go everywhere and preach the gospel, evangelize to the nations. I plan to start a Bible school. We started doing it at a smaller scale. With all this knowledge coming up, I think we can do a better job.","What are challenges you’ve faced in ministry, and what have you learned from them?","Well I think a challenge we face in this country is doctrinal issues. With the coming in of the false prophet movement, and all religions, the challenge is to ground the people in the Word of God, so they should know what the truth is. So basically, that’s the personal challenge, but as well as the challenge of the church. People are flocking in to false doctrines, so this is the challenge. If we can well be trained, we can learn to train others. <br><br>From the challenges, what I’ve learned is that if we can be well grounded, just like what we’re doing here, we should be able to ground people in the Word of God, and they’ll be able to stay.",How did you first hear about Jesus? How did you come to believe He died for your sins?,"I’ve been hearing about Jesus from when I was an infant. I used to go to Sunday School. I wasn’t yet a Christian until the age of 12. I heard through Nazarene preacher from America. He was preaching about Jesus. Well, I came to believe because the Spirit of God convicted me. So I was convinced when I heard that Jesus died for my sins, I was convicted and I believed. When the word was preached, I could definitely hear the words that were said about God and the gospel. I was convicted. I knew I was a sinner.",What is your favorite thing about Malawi?,"The gospel is easy to preach because people are not as busy as they are in the developed countries. You can interrupt anybody, anywhere, anytime, and they will be ready to hear the gospel. Where as in the States, it’s different altogether. It is easy to preach the gospel. You cannot be victimized. There is no laws. There is freedom of worship. It is unlike the Muslim countries. Here, we have Islam, yes, but it’s free for all. You can preach the gospel anytime, anywhere.",What is one of your favorite verses and why?,"Acts 10:34. Through the Scripture, I have learned to believe in myself.

How did you decide to become a pastor?,"I am pastoring a church in one of the outskirts within the city, yes. I’ve been pastoring that church for 5 years.<br><br>Um, actually because pastoral work, it’s about calling. And when I was growing up… by the way, I’m coming from a Catholic background. When I was growing up, that never crossed my mind, that one of the days I would be a priest, because that’s within Catholicism, eh? Never thought of that.<br><br>But when I came to the Lord in 1998, and… that feeling of serving the Lord, conviction to serve the Lord… I sensed it upon my heart. And I knew that one day, I will be serving the Lord, sure.",How did you come to believe that Christ died for your sins?,"Like I said early on, that I was a Catholic. And you know Catholics—I don’t have to speak a lot on that because as Catholics… few can tell you who Christ is. I just lived like that. To be precise, I was just a nominal Christian, just a churchgoer; but no serious relationship with Christ.<br><br>And it was in 1998 when I was in Zomba, the former capital city of Malawi, and as I was there, I don’t know the last time I visited church. There I was just doing whatever I was doing, and drinking and all that. So it was one of the days that I had an encounter with the Lord, especially through His Word when somebody was preaching.<br><br>And that message, when the man was preaching… all the stuff that was talking, it was as if he was talking about me! And it was as if he knew that somebody who possessed those kinds of traits was there.<br><br>And after hearing that message, I went home, and I was convicted. And it wasn’t long [before] I came to the Lord in the same month, that was in 1998 in August, yes, in Zomba. And I received Jesus Christ as my personal Lord and Savior in one of the Assemblies of God churches.<br><br><i>After that, you decided you wanted to be a pastor?</i><br><br>Ah, it was not immediately. Yeah, because when I came to the Lord, I sensed that one day, I would preach. So because as I was just a [spiritual] baby and I was growing up, I was learning the word of God and learning the things about God, and as I was going through that process, a desire to serve the Lord kept on coming, and I felt that one day, I would preach.<br><br>So it was up until 2000, that’s when I started ministering like an evangelist—meeting people, encouraging others, leading others to Christ, and all that.",What are some challenges you have come across in ministry?What has the Lord taught you in these challenges?,"Ay, lots of them. But the Lord has been faithful and has been good. One of the challenges is, you’re looking at somebody because… I’m 37 now, but the time I was coming to the Lord, I was a teenager, 19 or somewhere.<br><br>And to seriously be a follower of Christ at that time, and you’re breaking link with your peers, that was a difficult thing to do. But because my heart was set for Christ, I said, “I am going.” And we’ve been encountering so many things. We’ll go to some place to preach the gospel and there people will not receive the gospel, and they’ll be telling all sorts of things… so many things! So many things.<br><br>And at the same time you’ll be tempted, you see, meeting the old peers, the old friends that you used to hang around with. And you meet them and they mock at you, they laugh at you, they think you have made a wrong decision, they think you have gone crazy simply because you have given your life to Christ—all those things!<br><br>And the most difficult one was now breaking the links with Catholicism, because my whole family was Catholic. And I was the only one who had come to the Lord, and I was attending a different fellowship, a different church. That didn’t go well with most of my family members—my mother, my brothers and my sisters, they were all against my decision to move out of Catholic. So I said, “Please. It’s my life. It’s my life, and I have decided to follow Christ. So whatever you do, whatever you say, that won’t change my mind.” So I’ve gone through some persecutions, because they wanted to force me back to Catholic. And I said, “No. I can’t go back.”<br><br>So, those are some of the things that I have come across. And if I talk about some other issues, well, it’s just part of pastoring the ministry, yes.<br><br>One thing I can boldly say, the Lord has taught me is to put my trust in Him, and in Him alone. Because several times, when you put your focus on the wrong things, when you focus on people—people, they change. People, they can disappoint you; people have let me down. So, I’ve learned in all the things I have gone through, I have learned, put my focus on Christ and Christ alone. And He has never disappointed me—He never fails.",You did your diploma at CAPA also. How did that change the way you did ministry or the way you look at the Bible?,"Oh yeah—very, very, very good question. Before I came here, before I did Advanced Diploma, I was… I was just a preacher who just begin from nowhere and end nowhere, if you may understand what I mean.<br><br>I was not organized in my sermons, and to some extent, I was more into allegorical preaching because I didn’t know what it means to exegete a passage and to stay to the passage, and to focus on what the text says, not to add or not to put your own ideas, and this is one of the best things that I have learned from CAPA here.<br><br>I have learned to diagram your text, to get the meaning from the text and not adding a meaning to the text. So previously, I used to preach like that. I would get a topic, then I would just go to the Bible to find some texts that could compound my message. But then! In the process, I found that most of the verses I was quoting, I was quoting them out of context, yes.<br><br><i>So then after that, you started going through the Bible verse by verse?</i><br><br>Yes! When I came here and we started practicing how to preaching God’s message and not to focus on man, or man’s needs, but just to preach God’s Word, I started practicing it. I started practicing it—I saw that I was missing a lot. Even if sometimes I could pick a text, but if I was preaching, I could not touch everything that was in the text.<br><br>But now, I have learned a good way of bringing out the truth from the text is doing expository. So this time around, I am sticking to my text. I’m allowing the text to determine, the text to speak, not me speaking on behalf of the text. Because this is God’s Word! I must allow God to speak through His Word.",What are some ways we can be praying for you?,"Well, since we are doing M.Div, and we are doing languages, Greek and Hebrew, of course we have started with Greek, and as we are advancing, we are also doing Hebrew. But challenge is, these are different languages! We are not accustomed to them, we are not used to them. And it’s tough!<br><br>But, if you can pray for us, pray that the grace of God should be sufficient enough for us to go through the course. Because the training that we are getting here, because we are being trained to preach, this is not just about academical work alone, but we are also talking about preaching God’s message.<br><br>So, if you want to pray for us, if you can pray for me, pray that the grace of God should be there, that whatever our lecturers are teaching us, we have to grasp the truth, and go out there, proclaim the truth.

Um… the first one I can say, support, because my church is small—20 people. But the majority are women who are single parents because most of men in my area, they go to South Africa looking for work, and they leave behind women with the children. So, my support, you know, cannot come from such type of congregation. And I am a married person—I have three children, all of them are in secondary school. So, I need money to send them to pay for their studies, and my survival.<br><br>And the other challenge is the place of worship—we were using a classroom so we had to identify our own property. But, that one, we haven’t yet fully paid for that property, such that 2 weeks ago, the owner threatened us to leave the place if we do not pay the remaining amount of money.<br><br>Yeah, the other challenge is that… people not coming to church regularly.

So, even Sundays, you find them absenting themselves from church, and looking for money.<br><br>Um, there is also another challenge, and this is, lack of Bibles. [<i>pause</i>] The church… lacks Bibles. You know, members cannot manage to buy Bibles, most of them.

Dennis Banda,What do you like to do during your free time?,"A lot of things that I like to do. During my free time, I’ll say watching movies. Yeah, especially Christian movies. Yeah, films. Like, after studying, yeah sometimes I also like to listen to songs. Yeah.<br><br>

<strong>What type of music?</strong><br>

I like local music. Yeah, Malawian local music. And also, hymns, yeah. It also reminds me my college days. Yeah, when I was at college, we used to sing in chapel, yeah, every morning. So it reminds me of my college days. Yeah.<br><br>

<strong>We heard you guys singing in chapel yesterday. It was beautiful.</strong><br>

Thank you. Yeah, it is what we like, and it is part of the Malawian culture. Yeah, wherever you go, you find people singing. At funeral, we sing; during weddings, we sing; so in church, we like to sing. And not only to sing, but also to dance. Yeah, it’s what we like. [<em>laughs</em>]",In what ways has the Lord grown you this past year?,"Oh, yeah, especially in the area of preaching. Yeah, I feel I'm getting better and better, yeah, I can see the way I'm preaching these days is not the way I used to be. Yeah, I'm getting better and better, because of the skills I'm receiving here at CAPA. I mean the truths here, the material, the teachings, yeah, that I'm receiving here at CAPA. Even my church is also benefiting a lot, yeah, because I'm giving them Bible-based messages.",What are you looking forward to this year?,"We have to study Hebrew, yeah, and it's a language which I wanted also to learn. Yeah, last year, we studied the Greek, and we are told that next year, [which] is this year, we'll start Hebrew, and we're looking forward to learning this language. Because by learning this language, it will help me to preach, especially Old Testament, yeah. So I'm looking forward to this year.",What wisdom from wise men has benefited your ministry?,"Yeah. I'll say Pastor Matt Floreen. Yeah, he's a pastor at IBF [International Bible Fellowship] Church, and also, he's also taught a class at CAPA. I remember last module he's teaching us marriage and family counseling. Yeah, so, he's the one who I'll see. He's my mentor, because we will meet almost every month. We meet, going to his house. Yeah, we spend hours talking issues. Yeah, challenges, things I am going through.",What is your favorite memory at CAPA so far?,"Oh, yeah. There are many favorite memories here at CAPA. One of them I'll say is taking homiletics class with pastor Brian [Biedebach]. After [we] preach, he will show us what we did well and what we did not do well. Yeah, so that was my very memorable time I experienced at CAPA, yeah, having a class with Pastor Brian Biedebach, though he is in the States. Yeah, I miss him a lot.",What are your friendships at CAPA like?,"Yeah, my friendship with professors and fellow students — I'd say it is growing. Because we are kind of people from different regions, families, and even backgrounds. At first, it was tough. But now, I'm getting to know these professors, and even my fellow students. Yeah, so I would say my relationship with professors and the students is growing. Yeah, getting better.",What is one book from this past year that has impacted you?,"Oh yeah, there are many books that I’ve read this year. Especially, um, I’ve just forgotten the the title of the book. [<em>pause</em>] I remember… it is Sweetheart for the Lifetime.<br><br>

<strong>By Wayne Mack?</strong><br>

Yeah, yeah by Mack. I like that book, and it has challenged my life in many ways. It speaks about marriage. Honestly speaking, I had like wrong views of marriage, but that book has helped me a lot to have a biblical view of marriage.",What challenges have you faced in ministry so far?,"Oh, yeah,, the challenges that we face that, especially the area that where we are ministering, there are other churches which they don't preach the gospel, the true gospel. They preach prosperity gospel, social gospel, yeah, and there are also false prophets, and… that environment is difficult. And for people to come to a church where you're preaching the true gospel, um, it's not easy. But I think God, it is Him who brings the light to people.","If you could leave a word of encouragement to your fellow Christians in Malawi, what would you say?","I'll say it's good to know the Word of God, because many people, they are trusting more people. They're trusting so-called ""man of God"" [the pastor], not the Word of God. So it's very important to trust in the Word of God, not so-called the ""man of God."" Because God has made Himself known to us through His Word, so it's good to know His Word and also to stay in the Word.",,,,,,,,,,

Alexander Chirwa,What do you like to do during your free time?,"When I am on free time, I love swimming and…because I stay close to the lake, I like swimming, and I like riding a bicycle. Yeah.",In what ways has God grown you this past year and what has He been teaching you?,"God has been helping me be a servant-leader. I understand that I am in this ministry for the purpose of serving other people. First, [I thought] that people need to serve us as pastors. But when I started coming here at CAPA, and digging the Word in depth, I've realized that I am a servant. I need also to be humble and to serve people.",What are you looking forward to this year?,"Yeah, this year, I'm waiting that I'll grow more deeper in the insight of the Word of God. I am expecting that the area of knowledge, knowing God better should grow. And I expect that at the end of this year, I'll have more knowledge. I'll have more understanding about God.",What wisdom from wise men has benefited your ministry?,"I’ve realized in this field, there’s a lot of things which you don’t know. You need other people [who] have more knowledge than you to assist you, to help you. So these professors, the visiting professors, has been helping us a lot. Rick Holland. The time he came, I really saw that my life – it was worth it to come here [to CAPA]. It has assisted me in so many areas better to understand the Word of God, and I thank God that I am here and the visiting professors come. And I believe that I will also take this knowledge to other people because as we interact with them my life has never been the same, has been transformed.<br><br>

<strong>In what ways has your life been transformed?</strong><br>

Mainly, it’s how can I preach the Word. At first, I was preaching, but in my preaching, I could not concentrate on the Word of God. It’s like I was just preaching whatever comes in my mind, whether it’s Word of God or not, I could just preach an hour. But when I came here, I realized that I need to preach the Word, not my feelings, not what I want, not what I've heard, maybe from TV or from wherever, but I need to preach the Word of God from the Bible.",How has CAPA influenced your family life?,"Family life – I’m married. I’m married to Ellen. We have been together for 13 years, but when I went to the subject of marriage, I realized that I need to have a agape commitment, whereby I need to go back to my wife and have some things, do some things in agreement.<br><br>

As a pastor, I need to make my family as an example, so I had a lot of issues as a human being: issues of submission, issues of love, yeah. So, when I attended that course, it changed my life.",How has one book influenced your thinking and living in the past year?,"One other book? The books written by John MacArthur is very sound in doctrine. Wherever I find it on a shelf, I take it and read it because I understand that John MacArthur is [a] person who has vast knowledge in ministry, and he has talked about a lot of the issues which has been problems in our community, and he tried his best to come out with the sound doctrine.",What are your friendships at CAPA like?,"Friendships? With my friends, it has also been very good. It has helped me to realize that I can also live in harmony with friends different denominations – some pastors from Baptist church, and others from Presbyterian, and I'm from Pentecostal. So it has also helped me to have friends with new friends here. I'm not from this town; I'm coming from outside this town, and I've also found friends from this town, that is from Lilongwe, and other parts also who are coming here to study.",What challenges have you faced in ministry overall?,"First is finance. As Malawi, our country is very poor. Yeah, so, for the ministry to become vibrant, you need some financial resources. So the first challenge which we meet is resources, finances, that you can have something which can help you — for you to do ministry better, such as books. To buy books here is expensive, to buy materials like Internet is expensive, and yeah, so that’s the first challenge.<br><br>

Second challenge is issue of commitment. People are very busy. As I said, our country, things are very hard so people work very hard in order to make [a living]. So that’s again, it’s another challenge to ministry because you find that people are very busy. You want to teach them, but people are busy.",What are your future plans for ministry?,"Wow. My future plans for ministry… I'm a teacher. I feel that my calling is teaching. My future plan is when I finish this study here, I will also try to establish a way I can impart the knowledge of God. Because I've found that a lot of pastors out there, they need the knowledge that I have found here. So I want to teach there.","If you could give a word of encouragement to your fellow Christians in Malawi, what would you say to them?","A word of encouragement is that knowledge is power. We do better things when we have knowledge. It's not good [to] just rush in the ministry and saying things which looks like it is biblical but is not biblical, because we are accountable to God in the end. So it is better to be trained first and understand the Bible first and let you [be] helped first before you go out and start helping other people.",,,,,,,,
Joseph Chirwa,What is one attribute of God that you personally experienced this past year?,"The providence of God, that He is provider, but also, He gives strength. Yeah. Because my father passed away, I’ve experienced His comfort and His strength.",In what ways has the Lord grown you this past year? What is He teaching you?,"He’s taught me to love His Word more, to study His Word, to put into practice.",What are you looking forward to this year?,"I’m looking forward to keep on learning, especially we are starting like learning Hebrew, so I know that the more I learn Hebrew, I also learn more from His Word.",What wisdom from wise men has benefited your ministry?,"Mostly I’ve learned from wise men to be patient in ministry, and also to be a man of integrity, to try to please God adamantly, not just to please men, but to do ministry as a way of honoring and glorifying God.",What is your favorite memory at CAPA?,"My favorite memory is the day we started to translate 1 John, chapter 1 to 5, from the Greek into the English. Yeah. <br><br><strong>Why is that your favorite memory?</strong><br>Because it was something that I’ve been praying for for almost five years, to learn the biblical languages. So it was like an answer to my prayers.<br><br><strong>Why was it a prayer for you for five years to want to learn the Bible in the original languages?</strong><br>Because when I started pastoring, I went to Bible college to do a degree, but there was no depth in what I learned. I didn’t know why we believed in certain things, so I couldn’t preach from parts of the Bible. So I wanted to study the Bible more, so I was praying for a place that I could go to to learn more of His work and of the Bible. So there is no opening, but I kept on praying until some one friend told me about CAPA.","What has been your favorite class at CAPA so far, and why?","[<em>smiling</em>] Greek, obviously. And Old Testament theology, because it is like, when we were studying the Old Testament’s theology, it was like I was learning the foundation of our faith as believers.",What are your friendships at CAPA like?,"Almost like everyone is a friend. Many of the people I didn’t know before, so it is like, I’m more connected now to many pastors in Malawi. Since I’ve started, I’ve preached at other churches of some of [the pastors] I’ve met here, and also they have come to our church. Although we come from different denominations, but the things we are learning here give us like a common ground, and a similar type of preaching, expository preaching. So I’ve made many friends here.",How has one book you’ve read this past year influenced your thinking and your living?,"One book that I’ve read, it is <em>Sweethearts for Life</em> [by Wayne Mack] for marriage and family. It has helped me to look at my family and to treat my wife and children in a new way. To be considerate to them, to be their leader, not in a controlling way, but in a loving way.",What challenges and joys have you faced in ministry?,"I’ve faced the challenge of, like, I’ve started a church in 2013, a new church, so for a church to grow, there are so many challenges. But the joys are like, when you see a family, like which used to be Muslim, they come to Christ and they start attending church, that’s the biggest joy, to see them grow in the Lord. It’s a joy.<br><br><strong>Did that happen at your church?</strong><br>Yeah. Many, many times.",What are your future plans for ministry?,"My future plans is to continue opening churches, especially in the rural areas, where they don’t have many churches.","If you could give a word of encouragement to your fellow Christians in Malawi, what would you tell them?","I would tell them to study the Bible more, because I know that many people in Malawi go to church. Some are nominal Christians. They call themselves Christians, but they don’t go to church regularly. But many people are illiterate, as far as Bible knowledge is concerned. So I would encourage them to study the Word of God, to do what it says, because it’s a blessing to know the Word and to do it is what God wants.",,,,,,
Lewis Chirwa,What is your hometown like? Did you grow up in Lilongwe?,"I would say, yes. Much of my years have been in Lilongwe, that is, the town of Lilongwe, but I come from the northern part of Malawi. And I lived there for the first ten years of my life, and then I moved over to Lilongwe, so from that time, I've been in Lilongwe. There's some differences in terms of food and [clothing].",What's your favorite memory at CAPA from last year?,"One of them is that I like the way the material is being taught at CAPA. I would say it's very rich and so nourishing to me as a student, as well as equipping me so that I am able to relay that information to others. For instance, I will tell you that I will use what I've been taught here to teach at my church.",What has been your favorite class so far?,"Marriage and counseling. Family, marriage, and counseling.",What's one attribute of God that you personally experienced this year?,I would say I'm so much pursuing holiness – the holiness of the Lord and His mercy and grace because I know that I cannot survive on my own and that there is nothing I can do if I go by myself. So the Lord is at the center of my life.,What wisdom has benefited your ministry at church?,I teach Sunday school and I do a bit of counseling. I counsel the youth as well as those who are about to get married.,How has CAPA influenced your own family relationships?,"It has changed my relationships so much. There were some things that I took for granted. There were some things I thought could never be changed. But right now with the classes that I am taking, they have changed so much about my perception about myself, my wife, my children, as well as my greater family and my neighbors.",In what ways has the Lord grown you this year?,"I would say the Lord has grown me in wisdom, and how I'm relating with my family and how I'm relating with my church and the members of my church.",What are you looking forward to this year?,"This year, I'm mainly looking forward to serving the Lord in other dimensions. Like, right now I'm working with families because I do young couples ministry. Those who are young in marriage. And right now, we are trying to put up a conference where those couples will come together within our church or within our denomination so that we are able to share experiences and teach one another. So that's one thing I'm looking forward to growing and imparting others as well as learning from others.",What challenges have you faced in your ministry?,"Several challenges. I would say one of them is lack of cooperation from other stakeholders. You know, sometimes when you are teaching things that people are not familiar to, there is a lot of resistance, so that has brought a lot of challenges.<br><br>

In addition to that, there is a challenge in terms of finances, to get materials and staff and get things running, like another ministry I am involved in where we go about ministering in the prisons – the lack of resources to reach as many prisons as we can. So that’s another challenge.<br><br>

The other challenge, I would say, in terms of the location that I live in, it is such a location that needs the Lord. It needs intervention from the Lord. So that’s a challenge from within the vicinity.","If you could leave a word of encouragement to your fellow Christians in Malawi, what would you say to them?","I would say they should not be relaxed in terms of how we serve the Lord, in terms of how we believe in His word, in terms of how we go about with our everyday business, in terms of serving the Lord. I'll even say we should not be taken away by the teaching that have just come awash whereby there is a lot of things that are said that are most of them are unbiblical. So that should be taken away from our lives. Actually we should go about by saying we should test every spirit.",,,,,,,,

Peter Chiwaula,What is your hometown like?,"Basically, this is Lilongwe, Malawi, the warm heart of Africa. Our town is mixed. It has urban areas and rural areas. But I stay in the urban areas and we're close to some rural areas, but we've got about a population of about maybe more than 1.7 million people in the city of Lilongwe. But, um, we have different people. We've got Christians, Muslims, and we have people who don't believe in God, and we have people who believe in traditional beliefs. We have different races and different ethnic groups.",What do you like to do during your free time?,"What I like to do during my free time is interact with people. I also like to photography. And I love reading. Not reading books per se, but I just love to do research. So that's what I like doing. And I also love poetry. Sure. That's what I pretty much love to do.",What is your favorite memory at CAPA so far?,"My favorite memory at CAPA is when is when I saw the [Advanced] Diploma class graduate. And I was doing photography, but I envisioned myself that three years from now I will be graduating too. So, it was more like a reflection from what the diploma class has achieved to what I will achieve after finishing my years at CAPA, so that was the most memorable time at CAPA, where I saw that the fight is worth it and I just need to keep trusting God. Sure.",What has been your favorite class?,"My favorite class here at CAPA has been counseling. Yeah, especially marriage and family counseling. &lsquo;Cause I see a lot of problems in different families, my own family -- I'm not married, but [the family] I come from. I've seen Christian marriages tear down, but [that's] not supposed to be God's plan for marriage. And I just learned how much of a big picture marriage is in relation to who God is and in relation to His people and Christ to the church. So that was one of the most wonderful classes I attended and was helpful, which I think will help me in the future to help others, but also my family when I get married, to have a good and God-fearing family. Sure.",What is one attribute of God you personally experienced this past year?,"I've experienced God is gracious. I've seen that in the struggles that I have, mainly to pay [school] fees. 'Cause I finance myself and I don't have a job currently, but He has managed to see me through. But not only that, I had struggles with Greek. But this time around it seems like I've caught up with the guys and I see grace in that and just to be back here again. I've seen God [be] gracious in many ways and through the classes that I've attended, lessons that I've learned. I've seen God is a gracious God and loving towards me. So, grace is one attribute of God that I've seen. Graciousness, yeah.",What wisdom from wise men has benefited your ministry?,"Sure, so, let me think of John Koh [of Faith Bible Church]. John Koh, he came from the States to [teach] us. He said a lot of things, but what stood out the most for me as a pastor was that he really spends time in [the] Word and in how he… he gives his everything to serve people, in the work that God has given him. And that he doesn't look at his needs, but he looks at the needs of the people before his own needs, so that he makes sure that nothing can hinder him to fulfill what God has called him to do. And in so doing he doesn't have anxiety and God really takes care of him. So as a young man going to ministry, I have my own fears and needs, but with that word of wisdom as an encouragement to focus on what God has called me to do and knowing that if He has called me, He'll give me the grace and strength to go on ahead. So that really encourages me in all aspects of my life. Sure.",How has CAPA influenced your family life?,"CAPA has really impacted a lot. First of all, as a Christian, I saw my family that… I thought we’re all Christians, which we are. But once you become a Christian, it doesn’t mean that you don’t need the gospel anymore. You need to be reminded of the gospel each and every day. Just as to understand and also to know if you are truly in the faith according to 1 John, which we just finished in Greek translating, yeah. We need to once and again test ourselves, we need to examine ourselves [to see] if we are truly in the faith, if we’re truly walking with Christ. So what I’ve seen is that it’s very important as a pastor within your family to continually evangelize to your family, and to share the Word with them, so that they can be in line with God’s Word and just dig into God’s truth.<br><br>

But it has also taught me to be above reproach. My family, to know how to carry myself ‘cause this is people who see my everyday life. They know my flaws, and if there’s anyone who has to be by my side to say, “Peter is above reproach” before my pastor, first it has to be my family, ‘cause this is the people who spend time with me. They sleep with me, they eat with me. They know everything I do. They spend most of time with me, right? So I’ve learned how to also carry myself above reproach and to pastor them first before pastor[ing] everyone else.<br><br>

So I think of as me and my household have made a choice to serve the Lord — Joshua, right? So in the same idea, before he led out a people, he had to make sure that he leads his family. So that’s an important thing that I’ve also learned which is just a personal reflection about, yeah, of my life at CAPA and family, at home. And even my, my fiancée, my girlfriend, yeah sure. My girlfriend [<em>laughs</em>], rather than fiancée, who I hope to marry in the near future after I propose, yeah.
",In what ways has the Lord grown you this past year?,"What the Lord has taught me is that I'm vulnerable, like anyone else. And that I also need to be on guard, not [thinking that] just because [I'm] in a Bible school that makes you perfect. But each and every day I need to thirst for Him, I need to desire for Him. So desiring God each and every day has become my pursuit, whereby the more truth I'm given, much more responsibility I have to share -- but not only share, but also to practice it, to live it out. So I've seen how much responsibility God has handed to me. Yeah, so I've learned that I need to give out my best and to run the race to the finish. With all my strength, like I've not attained the prize yet. Yeah.",What are you looking forward to this year?,"This year, after finishing Greek basics, um, we’re studying Hebrew. I’ve had problems with languages, right? But I’m looking forward to be on top with my Hebrew classes. I don’t want to slide behind like Greek. But I’m also looking forward to be grounded much more in the Word and to be more conversant with God’s Word where I can be ready at anytime to go out and to teach and to preach to other people.<br><br>

So as a person, not only as a student, I am looking forward to having more doors for ministry opened where I can go minister to people and teach people God’s Word and transform lives through the Word of God and win more souls to Christ, God willing, as I’ll preach, and to see them grounded in God’s Word, ‘cause my passion is to see people be deeply rooted in the truth of Christ. Yeah.",What challenges have you faced in ministry so far?,"Okay, ministry challenges. I can say, as I work with the youth ministry, my challenges have been to get hold of the youth so that we can increase our number of attendance. ‘Cause our church membership is really high, and the youth membership is quite on the high as well, but the youth attendance in meetings for the youth is low. So it’s been a challenge to find out ways in how to bring them. So we’ve tried different ways, so in the near future, we’ll plan to giving our all and my everything to give out to the team I work with, that we can see the youth grow, but not only grow, but also be committed to God’s work.<br><br>

So our future plan is to have activities that engage the youth and that they can feel part of the youth ministry. And also, to bring in programming which should keep them in church because we find the rise of other ministries in town where they are not really sound in teaching, where people go there for excitement, or for whatever reason. But then we want to have a good teaching but also an engaging ministry and a joyful ministry where people will enjoy and look forward to go listen to God’s Word, but also just to fellowship with one another.",What are your future plans for ministry?,"For the future, I want to become a pastor. I’m looking forward to work under leadership of my church. I’m hoping to serve [in any way]. Who knows, I might be sent into some village to minister. I’m okay with that. I could do that.<br><br>

But what’s pressing [on my] heart is the youth ministry in the city, so my hope is to see young men take responsibility and rise up and know that they are the leaders [of] the other people, [leaders] who can preserve the church and its truth. So I’m hoping to see that. From now on, my target, my purpose. is to see God’s youth learn the truth of God and carry it wherever they go, and to grow in it, and they can teach it to the younger generation. By so doing, by the time I will be 50 years old, which is 25 years from now, I know that they’re going to be grown up, fathers and mothers, who know the Word in its truth and its totality and their children know the truth as well.","If you could leave a word of encouragement to your fellow Christians in Malawi, what would you say?","A word of encouragement will be that He who called you is faithful. He'll finish the good work He's started in your life. So don't be afraid when God calls you. Step up and just do what He has called you to do. And if you are passing through trials and tribulations, know that the trials and tribulations can't compare to the future glory that God has, has in plan for us. So be of a good cheer, be courageous, and be cheerful, and be joyous. In all things count it all joy.",,,,
Samson Cholokoto,What is one attribute of God you personally experienced this past year?,"More of His love is what I have come to understand more. Going through the book of Romans. How He has justified us through Jesus Christ. Yes, sure. Yeah, Romans 5, 8, chapter 4, as well. Justification by faith.",In what ways has the Lord grown you this past year?,"I think He has grown me a lot in terms of prayer, and also in the area of looking well after my family. Yes, as per the instructions of Scripture. Especially the kids, the instructions, raising them up in the instruction of the Lord. Sure. I think that the kids are behaving well now. I also go through the Scriptures with them. They now understand what the Lord requires for them as children, and what the Lord requires of us as human beings as well.",What are you looking forward to this year?,"This year, I'm looking forward to know more about God, especially this time around when we have just studied Hebrew, beginning Hebrew. I'm looking forward to understand more of the Old Testament, the truth, the foundational truth that is coming from the Old Testament, and marrying that with New Testament theology, which I'm more familiar [with] than the Old Testament.",What wisdom from wise men has benefited your ministry?,"Yes, yes, a lot. One of the leaders in our church. We call him Pastor Ndovi. He has been of great help. He is mentoring us in the Lord. How to live as man as through the teaching of the Bible as well. How we need to have patience, how we need to suffer a lot, with a love for Him. Not really as an outward thing, but as something that is coming from truly inside of us. Sure.",How did you learn about CAPA?,"I just got a brochure from my senior pastor actually. And I looked at the brochure itself and what CAPA is trying to do, I thought I should really come and study, because [my pastor] has really been of great help to me.<br><br>

It has really opened my eyes a lot. We have done hermeneutics, and still doing it, but I should think that previously, I used to go into Scripture with so many presuppositions, which are not true. But looking at all the hermeneutics class, it has given us looking at the Greek text. I am now able to get to the meaning of the text and what the original author intended to say and how it applies to our lives today. Sure.<br><br>

<strong>What are some presuppositions that you had before?</strong><br>

Yeah, there’s so many examples. Um, like, previously, um, I’d say during prayers, you just quoting of Matthew 18, you’d be saying whatever I bind here on earth is bound in heaven. And you know, you used to pray like binding demons with that Scripture. Those were just presupposition because we now after learning hermeneutics, studying the text, you know it’s not talking about such things. It’s actually talking about discipline. So such presuppositions are now gone. Sure.",What is your favorite memory at CAPA so far?,"Yes, my favorite memory is actually studying Greek. Yes. It's a favorite memory going through it and looking at the original text. It's so rich and so precise as well, more than the English version that we use now, so it's very helpful to learn Greek. Sure.",What are your friendships like at CAPA?,"Yeah, at CAPA, we live like family. The students live like family. And our professors are kind. We're able to mix up with them. They eat what we eat. We sit together. We mix up. We really have a good relationship and friendship with the students and the teaching faculty.",What is one book from this past year that has impacted you?,"Yes. <em>Idols of the Heart</em> [by Elyse Fitzpatrick]. Yeah. Idols of the Heart really have formed a really big impact upon my life. Because previously, you used to have demands on God that I really want this, God, and if you don't do it, it's like maybe God is weak or He's not willing to bless, et cetera. But I have realized that those things are just idols of the heart. What matters the most is to have God whether in suffering or in riches, God must be central. Yeah.",How has CAPA influenced your family life?,"Yes, I think… [it] has brought me and my wife very close, because there are times that we have assignments. Those assignments, I have to do with my wife. Mainly from marriage and counseling, but also from pastoral ministry. So doing those assignments together, she discovered some areas that according to the Bible, I’m not doing well. So she’s able to come through to me oftenly ‘cause she knows the Scripture’s authority, whereas previously we wouldn’t do that. But it also impacts on our life as well because the things that are required of me, it’s also an instruction even to her. So there’s a bit of a accountability. [<em>laughs</em>]<br><br>

<strong>What is one example of an assignment you had to do with your wife?</strong><br>

Like the elders’ evaluation qualifications, yeah, so you go through all the qualifications. The elder should be a man of one wife, able to instruct his children, not a novice, and several of that things, being able to even take care of his family. So going through all those things has been so helpful. Patient… and so many things in there. Sure.",What challenges have you faced in ministry so far?,"If I would say a challenge, maybe in terms of ministry, I'll talk about time. Because school demands time. There are assignments and also you have to be in class, and at the same time there are demands of ministry as well, which has to be met, so the challenge is how to push your time for both to move well. So if there has been a challenge, I think it's time for ministry, time for school, but I know both comes from the Lord.","If you could leave a word of encouragement to your fellow Christians in Malawi, what would you say?","If I give an encouragement to Malawians, I will encourage them to really study the Bible in its context, because when we miss the context of the Bible, our interpretation will always be wrong. And once you miss God's meaning, you miss God's Word. So, my encouragement to Malawians is that we should be able to study. I really wish everyone, every person in ministry will have the ministry that we have now of learning here at CAPA. If everyone was here to learn, so that we can teach the truth out there. I know people are trying to teach the truth but when you don't have the tools, it doesn't work out well. So here, we're getting truths, so I hope that everyone has the same tools so we can really preach the word of truth.",,,,,,
Chizaso Chunga,What do you like to do during your free time?,"Yeah, I like playing musical instruments like keyboard, singing, sometimes I join the church choir and sing. And I also like playing volleyball. I sometimes watch films.",What is one attribute of God that you personally experienced this past year?,"I’ve experienced the sovereignty of God. God has been very sovereign in His provision in my life. He has provided for my family. Just recently, He saved me in a mysterious way. I was about to be involved in a car accident but He saved me from that. I could see His sovereignty because He’s always there for us. He’s always powerful. Yes. I think He has a plan for my life, so He saved me. Yes.<br><br><strong>Is there a passage that you really enjoy reading that reminds you of God’s sovereignty?</strong><br>Yes, when I read Psalm 139, when He says He is omnipresent. I feel also He is sovereign. How can someone be everywhere? It means He’s sovereign. He’s a powerful God as He is omnipresent. He is sovereign because He uses His power to be available anywhere and support us. Yes. ",In what ways has the Lord grown you this past year? What has he been teaching you?,"I feel that the Lord has taught me many lessons for me to grow. He has given me responsibilities within this year that are, I can say, more than I expected. And through those responsibilities at the local church and at the national level, I feel He has something very great for my life. So, all through lessons that He’s teaching me that He can trust me with something greater than maybe I feel myself. Sometimes I feel like I’m still young. How can He trust me with this position? But the thing, the responsibility, all those are lessons that He is teaching me. The Lord is teaching me to trust in Him, that: “You have to trust in Me that you can not do on your own.” So I feel He is also drawing me far from where I was, closer to Him, so I can learn that I should trust more on Him. Yes.",What are you looking forward to this year?,"As we have just started this year, I’m looking forward to having greater time of learning at CAPA. At CAPA, we have lecturers who are experienced in teaching. They have congregations or ministries in which they are pastoring and they are coming here to impart their sermon experience so that we can also learn from them. So, I am expecting that I learn a lot from CAPA this year. <br><br>I’m planning to train other pastors, to equip them for further ministry in their local churches, yes. ",What wisdom from wise men has benefited you in your ministry?,"One thing that I’ve learned from the wise people from the lectures and other people is that repetition is the key to learning. You know sometimes when we are training our children, we feel disappointed when they fail maybe once. We don’t even encourage them to repeat on what they are doing so that they can learn, because it is a tool for them to learn. And even in my spiritual life, I know things that I do, I should do them everyday so that I should learn them until they sink into my heart and then I continue to keep practicing them.",What is your favorite memory at CAPA?,"My favorite memory that I will not forget is their acceptance, the warmth, [and] the oneness the lecturers provide to all of us. They always encourage us to be above reproach. That I will not forget. Because sometimes we compromise our integrity. We look like we live above reproach, but sometimes we find ourselves in compromise, but this has really helped me to say, “I have to be above reproach.” So, this is a very good memory that I will go take everywhere.",What are friendships like at CAPA?,"Yeah, I’m one of those people who are maybe slow to getting used to strangers. But you know at CAPA, it’s like everyone opens up to be friends with me so I love the people and they love me. Yes.",What has been your favorite class at CAPA and why?,"Greek. Ah! Because it is very tough [<em>laughs<em>] [INTERVIEWER: You like it because it’s tough?] Yes! It has taught me to humble myself. You know, we have responsibilities with congregations but when you come to class and learn Greek, it humbles you. So, it is becoming my favorite. [<em>laughs</em>]",How has one book you read this year influenced your thinking and living?,"Yeah, one of the books I’ve enjoyed most was <em>Shepherding a Child’s Heart<em> [by Ted Tripp]. That book has touched me because I have two little kids. So, it’s like, it is opening up a foundation for me to train those two kids. And even, I have not shared most of my books with my wife, but that one, I’ve shared with her, because I just like it. [<em>laughs</em>] It’s very, very good.<br><br><strong>Is there one point that the book made that stuck with you?</strong><br><br>Yes, you know in Malawi, sometimes they don’t allow you to, I can say most of the time, they don’t allow you to spank your child. They can even arrest you for that. But that book says, for a good purpose of disciplining your child, it will be very good. So, I like that point.<br><br>And some book says you don’t have to focus on changing the behavior, but you have to focus on telling the child about why that is wrong, meaning you also have to go to the root of why the child did that. Why did the child disobey? So, if you go there, that means the child will understand why you are spanking. So it helps. So it is about dealing with the heart and not just behavior which is just the signs of the heart. ",How has CAPA influenced your family life?,"You know, everyday we have assignments and my wife is getting used to that now. At first, it was very difficult even for me because sometimes I could not give her time. But now I have learned that despite all those assignments that you have, if we plan well our time, we can manage our family, our ministry, and school. So CAPA has helped me to learn how to plan well so that I can manage all the things that I do in my life.",What are the challenges or joys that you have faced in ministry this past year?,"I should start with the challenges. In Malawi, the biggest challenge is finances. Every ministry that you go to has the same [challenge]. And even my ministry has the same challenge about the finances. Sometimes we don’t raise enough money to run our programs and other things. But the joys are that God is doing His miracles and His great work. Because everywhere I minister in Malawi, God intervenes. God is always with me. Yes.",What are your plans for future ministry? Has it changed since last year?,"Yes, a little bit, though it was…last year, I was like a regional pastor. I was training pastors just within Lilongwe and central region. But this time, I’ve got the same vision of training them, but now it has expanded to the whole Malawi now. Yes.","If you could give a word of encouragement to your fellow Christians in Malawi, what would you say to them?","Yes! To my fellow Malawians I would say: yes, we have all the challenges as ministers in Malawi, but we have to be proud that we are Malawians. Let us learn from the experiences that we go through and let us use them as tools for future reference. We might be disappointed in one way or the other, but the morning is coming when we will rejoice.",,
Alfred Goliath,What do you like to do during your free time?,"My free time, of course, I like—what I like to do, it’s like visiting, maybe, some friends. But also like chatting with my family, yeah. My kids, yeah. There are some things that my children like to play with me. Yeah. So when I’m free, I say, “Let’s do this.” Like my last-born likes playing soccer, playing football. He’s young, seven years. But he likes football. Yeah. So sometimes, he can kick a ball to me at a time that I’m busy, that I say, “Please, when I’m free, we’ll do that together.” Sure.",What is one attribute of God that you personally experienced this past year?,"His holiness. Yeah. Holiness. God is holy. This has impacted me in the sense that when you understand that God is holy, it encourages me. It opens my mind, it opens my understanding, that if God is holy according to the Scripture, I need—I must also be holy. That gives me a passion, a desire to give myself to God through prayer and in a kind of activity that can help me to give myself to God. The holiness of God, that challenges me so much--there was a time that I was preaching from the book of Matthew, the Beatitudes, when Jesus Christ was with His disciples on the mountain, and He said, blessed are those who are holy, for they shall see God. So holiness is key. If you want to see God in your life, if you want to see God in your daily life, because we need God. Without God, we can’t do anything. We need God in our side in every activity, in every plan that we plan, we need God.",In what ways has God grown you this past year? What has He been teaching you?,"There are many things, but more like number one: how to live with my wife as a husband. Number one. For example, I know that since I started this school [at CAPA in 2014], starting from the [Advanced] Diploma classes, I learned that I am supposed to live exemplary to my wife, to my family. My wife and my children. And that challenged me so much. There were some areas where I noticed that I was not doing well. Then I said, “Lord, help me.” Because I want to perform my responsibility as a husband biblically.",What are you looking forward to this year?,"I’m looking forward to get more and more training. Because I know that as a pastor, I have a great task to shepherd the flock. It means that if I am blind, straightforward, the sheep also. I and the sheep, we’re all going to fall into the deep. Yeah, sure. So it means that whenever I’m here, I learn more things, new things. Yeah. I feel that there are other new things that I haven’t yet been taught. So I’m sure. I’m looking forward to getting more knowledge so that I can continue being well equipped, so that I can be a blessing, both to God, to the flock, and even to my family. Sure.",What wisdom from wise men has benefitted your ministry?,"Let’s say, for example, as we are interacting from one another here, you know, we are learning a lot. Yeah. Because it’s like when you see how someone is responding, is answering to the lecture, and also when someone is asking maybe some questions, you can learn something: this is the kind of life that I need to imitate, this is the kind of life that I need not to imitate. Yeah, sure. So from wise men, both spiritually, as well as physically. You know, spiritually, I mean how devoted some people are to God’s work, to God, and even to their families. Yeah, sure. So when you are interacting with somebody, you learn a lot. Yeah. His spiritual life, his spiritual position, how he loves the Lord, but even how he manages his family, but also how he manages time.",What is your favorite memory at CAPA?,"My favorite memory. I think I can say there are two. Yeah. There are many, but I must be specific.<br><br> Number one is biblical counseling. When we were in [Advanced] Diploma, we had counseling classes. And even now, we are still going on with that. Yeah. It is like introduction to biblical marriage, biblical counseling. Those things. And now that is the first topic, the first lesson that I will never forget, because when we are at Diploma, we are given like some assignments with our president [Jim Ayres]. Yeah. Asking us to take a trip with our wives, out going somewhere, which is a thing I didn’t even dreamed about. But then I said, “How am I going to do that? Where am I going to start?” Just going back and telling my wife, “Let’s go somewhere!” [<em>laughs</em>] “Let’s go!” Exactly. But little by little, you know, I was doing that in a sense of learning, but when I did that, I noticed that it brought something to my wife. Yeah. My wife noticed some changes in me, and I remember there was times that she said that, “Ah! I think this—[<em>taps table</em>]—this is what you are learning from, that you are going.” She noticed! Before I came here, it means that there is not that kind of life in me. So the first thing is this this course of counseling. <br><br>This has helped me much, not just me and my family, but the church. Because I am able now to know how to counsel people, with different problems. I am able to know where to start with these people, because most of the time, we lacked knowledge on how can I counsel this person with the issue he has brought to me. Yeah. But with this school now, I can say I have some little knowledge that I am able to help people.<br><br>The second one is now, when I’m here, you know, we are learning, like Greek, and yesterday we started Hebrew. Yeah. So this also has really helped me. A thing that I will never forget, we have started a thing like Greek exegesis. And this one is like an eye-opener to me. “Ah! Is it what it means?” <br><br>So these two, the counseling and the Greek and Hebrew language, I think I will never forget it, I’m sure that this is God who has brought me here, yeah, to learn at this school. I started ministry a long time ago, and I didn’t go anywhere to get knowledge on how to shepherd the flock, you know? Yeah. So I didn’t expect that today, I would be here doing this school. I started from Diploma, and today I’m here. To me, I’m just seeing God, that God has got a purpose for me, to shepherd his people, but also to shepherd my family. Yeah. Sure.",What are your friendships at CAPA like?,"Friendship. It’s beautiful. Yeah. It’s good. The visiting professors, the visiting lecturers who are coming here, it’s like, they do repeat. So the repetition of their coming here, to me, it’s like when we meet each other, you know, we remember, when you come here, what you taught us. It’s like a reminder—when we just see your faces, it’s just right there, it reminds us that, “Oh! Oh, yes. Now I’ve remembered the topic, what I’ve learned.” So you think, “Is there anything maybe that might be better to go back and refresh myself on that topic?” You see? So I think it’s really encouraging. It’s very strong, we are getting to know the heart from each other. Knowing the heart, not just verses. Sure.",What has been your favorite class at CAPA so far and why?,"Mm… my favorite one, Greek is a favorite class. Why? It’s because it deals with preaching. Yeah. So it’s like it helps you to understand the truth that is in the Word of God. It is very important to me because I’m a pastor. So maybe in the years past, thought I was preaching, I was ministering to people, but it wasn’t as it can be today, eh? It can’t to compare with today. <br><br>I am seeing that the learning of Greek, and also this language which we have just started, Hebrew, it can make a great difference in the field of ministry. Yeah. There are a lot, yeah. But this one is greater to me, because it’s like opening my eyes. Yeah. To serve God. Honestly, with all my heart, and faithfully. Sure. <br><br>",How has one book you read this past year influenced your thinking and your living?,"OK. The books that we have been receiving, they are a lot, it has refreshed my life, and also my living. we received also this book, <em>Sweethearts for</em> —you know this book. [<em>Sweethearts for a Lifetime</em>by Wayne Mack.] It’s a great book, because it speaks about men and women. How can they live fulfilled and fulfilling life towards his or her mate? Sure. So that one, it’s a great book, because it has impacted my life in the sense that I have learned a lot, according to the truth of God’s Word, according to the roles of husbands--oh! Ephesians chapter 5. To me, the roles he explained in that chapter, it’s incredible. Sure.",What challenges and joys have you faced in ministry this past year?,"The challenges, there are many. Yes. And to my understanding, I don’t take them as problems, because according to the Word of God, every field that a person can be has got its own challenges. So the challenges that I faced like the past years, for example, you know, like leadership. When you’re leading people, it’s not quite easy. It’s hard work. <br><br>So because there are some other people who doesn’t like being led in the path of truth, , say for example, you are correcting them, you are trying to bring them back to the right way of how to serve the Lord, they become your enemies. They start hating you, and they start speaking other things bad about you in order to destroy you. So in ministry, this is one of the challenges, that since I started serving God, it has been great. It has played a role in my life. <br><br>But it’s like on the other hand, those challenges, to me, I’ve also seen that they have a great benefit to my life, because once you are passing through those things, you learn some things, like you get equipped. When you pray to God to ask for His guidance in those problems, yes, you know, you learn a lot. And when you forge ahead, really, you make a difference through those things, just like David stated that, “I thank you that I was in trouble and it make me to learn more about you.”",What joys have you faced in ministry this past year?,"The joys? It’s like number one: Through the sufferings, through the trials that I was going through, the Lord intervened in many areas, in different areas. Finances, sicknesses, and when you are passing through difficulties, and you see God making provisions to you, to me, it’s a great joy.",Have your future plans for ministry changed since we interviewed you last year?,"Yeah. They have changed, my ministry plans have changed a lot, and I’m looking ahead to see more change. Because what I’m learning here is what is building my life. Now, as my life is being well-built, I do also see the very same need. That what God is doing in me, this also must be done in the members, the people that I’m shepherding. <br><br>So for example, our church is under construction. Here in Malawi, a self-supporting church—we support ourselves, we raise funds, and we contribute, and we build. So with that, when you are building, it’s like it becomes a great task, and it consumes all other programs. And without you being sensitive, it can even stop you from doing anything, including evangelism, and like any program that the Lord wants us to do. You know? <br><br>So little by little, sometimes I do discipling classes. Yeah, sure. And I’m looking ahead […]. And I was telling someone that right now, I’m planning also to just select a few people and to teach them what I’m learning from here. Not the whole congregation, but a few people, because the challenge that I’m facing now is that when I send somebody to preach when I tell them, “Please, can you do the work of ministry? I assign you to preach. I’m your pastor. Please, please.” There is some fear in them, thinking that maybe they can’t do to the level I’m doing. So we just discussing the best way to help the people, and even to help myself to lighten the work is just to choose a few people who are capable to do the work of the ministry to help me preaching, do the work of the ministry.","If you could give a word of encouragement to your fellow Christians in Malawi, what would you say?","Number one, what I would say concerning to my fellow Malawians who are in ministry, like myself, pastors. I met with somebody, when I told him about what I’m doing, it seemed like something that is not of any help to him. “Why?” It’s because where they are, what they are doing, they feel that they are OK. And everything is alright. They have reached their destiny, and they lacked nothing. <br><br>And now, with what I’m doing here, oh! My word to them is, the Bible says, “Blessed are those who are hunger and thirst for righteousness.” It means this hunger and thirst must not stop in us. We need to have more hunger to know God more and more, and also to serve God to the best level, not to our approval, but to God’s approval. So that’s my word, to tell them, wherever they are, whatever they’re doing. <br><br>My word to those who are out there is to tell them that they need to be under somebody. They need to be taught, so that in the field where they are, and to best to the glory of God. Sure.",,

Aubrey Gulumba,What do you like to do during your free time?,"My free time is — most of the time, I like chatting with my family. I have a good family with my wife and my children. And I also like soccer because I used to play soccer. So, I would watch soccer. That's what I do in my free time.",What is your favorite memory at CAPA so far?,"My favorite memory is learning Greek. And now I am able to do at least the translation of the Bible. So I have to remember when we were beginning learning, it was very difficult, especially the alphabet, but I've come this far. And I am now able to do translation. So that's what I remember most about CAPA.",What has been your favorite class?,"All of them might be good courses because each class is unique in its own way. I would probably decide Greek. Because, though I was not very good, but at least I enjoyed learning it, because there were certain thing that I learned that I didn't know in the past. And I also like expository preaching. It's very, very good. Because I know how to get a message drawn from the text. You have to look into the text. So these are the most two favorite courses at CAPA.",What is one attribute of God you personally experienced this past year?,"Ah, the grace of God. God has taken me this far. There were so many challenges for me to come to CAPA, because I'm working elsewhere, but God allowed me to come here. So, I remember that and I thank God because of that. Otherwise I wouldn't have come this far, and I know He [will] take me further.",In what ways has the Lord grown you this past year?,"He has been teaching me about patience, hard work, trust in Him always. When the times get tough, when the exams are difficult, trust in God. God has always been faithful. That's what He has been teaching me. It's not about the grades, but it's what you're learning in class here, and how are you going to apply that info when you go out. That's what He has been teaching me.",What are you looking forward to this year?,"I am looking forward to learning Hebrew. I just started today learning the alphabet. It's not easy. But I know throughout the year, by the end of the the year, I will be able to use the information that I've had in Greek, in Hebrew, theology, as well as other [things] we're learning, so that I can help my church much much better than I used to in the past, especially in teaching the Word of God. That's what I'm looking for, learn more about the word of God, learn more about God.",What are friendships like in CAPA?,"When I came to CAPA, most of people here, I didn’t know them. So I made a lot of friends with the lecturers and again with fellow students so we do have a good cordial relationship.<br><br>

<strong>Do you ever meet together outside of CAPA?</strong><br>

I think the one[s] who we are close to, we are within the same area, yeah, we do visit, especially in terms of studying together when there are exams. We sit down, discuss how are you going to answer this question, what about this assignment, can you assist me and so we assist one another when one is stuck. Sure.",How has one book you read this past year that has influenced your thinking or living?,"Yeah, a book about Sweethearts [for a Lifetime] by Mack. It's talking about the family — the husband and the wife, how they relate each other. It's a very nice book. It's part of one of our curriculum. I really enjoyed reading that book because it was always in my mind on the issues of family. I have been married for over 23 years, but when I read that book I [learned things] that I did not before. So I'm a better husband to my wife.",What challenges have you faced in ministry so far?,"The challenges are, you know, I am ministering in amongst the poor of the poorest, the area where we are. So, and secondly, most of the people, because of that, most of them they’re also not highly educated. Now, to understand certain things, it’s extremely difficult for them. Again, they do have needs. Physical needs. Now, these people they’ll look up to the pastor on almost everything [for physical needs]. I don’t have this, then the pastor will come in. I don’t have this, so it’s like the pastor, you’re kind of depended [on] by the people. So that’s a challenge, that the church, where we are, is facing.<br><br>

And I know, my fellow pastor do also face the same challenge. That the church expects a lot from the man of God, from the pastor, [more] than the pastor would expect of them. [And] if you do not do those things, they may interpret wrongly, that the pastor’s not caring, that he’s not meeting our needs. So, that’s a challenge that the church face here at Malawi. They’ll look at the pastor as if he’s over there [<em>holds hand above head</em>], he’s holier than them. They think the pastor cannot have any weaknesses.",What are your future plans for ministry?,"I’m working together with a fellow pastor here as an associate pastor to him. He is a main pastor. So my purpose for coming here is to go into full time ministry. Yeah, because I have never been trained in the ministry before. So CAPA is a step for me to going to full-time ministry. Because what I’m learning here is very powerful. And the advanced information, so I want make use of that information, because I know, others have indeed have contributed for me to be here.<br><br>

<strong>So would you say that this is your future ministry plan?</strong>

My future ministry plan is that — I’ve got the passion of teaching, teaching the word of God to the general masses. By the grace of God, I want to translate English Christian books into Chichewa. That’s our vernacular language. So that the local people may be in position to read the English book in the local languages, ‘cause most of them cannot read English. So that’s one of the areas which, I’m believing in God, that by the end of my term here, that’s the project I will come back on.","If you could leave a word of encouragement to your fellow Christians in Malawi, what would you say?","I will say, let's continue working with the Lord. As pastors, we got a very huge responsibility in our nation, because our nation depends on us in as far as the word of God is concerned. Let us not focus on material things, but let us focus on the spiritual, because once we get the spiritual, the material will become irrelevant. So if we continue preaching the word of God, being faithful to our calling in our ministry, then God is going to do His part. That's because we, our focus is on that for the Kingdom. Not the world's picture of a kingdom, but the kingdom of God at large. So that's what I'm gonna encourage the men of God out there. That we are here for a season, in this world. We should focus for the second coming of Christ. That should be our goal.",,,,,,

Aizzie Kalonga,What is one attribute of God you personally experienced this past year?,"Yeah. God is good, very good. God is gracious. And He’s taking me through. Looking at a lot of things that I have gone through… I mean, if it has been not God’s hand, I [would] not reach this far possibly. Looking at my family, looking at the church, even my education here, it’s just been God’s grace. I’d say God is gracious and merciful to me.<br><br>

<strong>What is one specific way that you experienced God’s grace last year?</strong><br>

I’ve got a number of things but I’ll just explain one or two. One of them is — I remember my wife fell sick, critically down. And she was told by the doctors more than three times she should be dead because she had problem with the reproductive system. And she was told she will not live longer than two months. That was a critical time for me.<br><br>

How can you say to me my wife is dying in two months? It was so horrible. We start praying, believing in God. After all, the medical doctors told us there is no remedy for this issue, so we do, we just go home and wait. She’s dying. I said, “No, I can’t swallow that. I can’t take that one.” So we had to pray. We believe God for that. So we prayed. We spent seven good days in the house, praying, just said, “God, come in. We have seen that everything has failed, but we know You cannot fail us.” So we prayed. By the end of the day, we went back to the hospital.<br><br>

To God be the glory! That the situation was completely different from what we received first. Because the doctor told us what they wrote on the paper and what they checked with the machines was totally different from what they observed this time around after we had prayed. So to me, God’s been gracious. You can see.<br><br>

And the second one, looking at the way I come here, at CAPA, I had no [financial] means. My education, you know, I’m coming from homes that are extremely poor. My mom didn’t go to school. My dad didn’t go to school. And my primary school has been a hurdle. My secondary school has been so difficult. My first degree program was so difficult. And I thought I’m done. I won’t go back. I won’t go back to school. I won’t go any further. That finding CAPA, I said, “Oh, to God be the glory!” I’m now taking master's degree in divinity. To God be the glory! I had no means. I was completely shut off. I had no opportunity. For me, to be here is God’s grace. Sure. Sure. Sure.",In what ways has the Lord grown you this past year?,"The Lord has grown me so far. The Lord has taught me patience. He’s dealing patience with me. So much. What I used to be is not what I am now. Sure. The Lord is also teaching me to stick to His Word and His promises. Stick to Him, no matter what type of wind may blow against me, or around me. I have to stick to His Word and His promises. He’s going to take me through. There are times… there are so bad times that I sometimes go through, but God has been so gracious in all those areas. He’s teaching me that I have to stick to Him, no matter whatever may come around, but I have to stick to Him. Sure. Some of the things God has been teaching me.<br><br>

<strong>How is God teaching you to be patient?</strong><br>

I’ve read so many books from CAPA. There is a certain book on anger. It’s something really good. It really came down on me. And they were teaching on this counseling on how to handle anger and some other things. So he gave us that book, and the book was just on my heart. It really taught me how to handle myself and I should not be so rush and rough and I have to be composed. I have to be a person that can be patient enough, not be so speedy, so harsh and so hard. I have to be patient. That’s what God has been teaching me here.<br><br>

<strong>Is that book <em>Uprooting Anger</em> [by Robert Jones]?</strong><br>

Yes, it’s <em>Uprooting Anger</em>! Yeah, it’s that. I have it. The CAPA people have given me. I have it at home. And I read it through, and I read it again. This book is just this good. It’s a very good book. Sure.",What are you looking forward to this year?,"I'm looking forward to take more on my studies. I'm enjoying Greek. Of course, I'm struggling with it. Hebrew is another [difficulty]. But I can see, I'm looking at the importance of learning these things. Because they are eye-openers. They are opening my eyes. How do I understand the Scriptures? So I'm looking forward to getting more from them, that I should be able to read the Scriptures with open mind, interpret them correctly, and possibly preach them the way they are. So that I should not preach something like the Scriptures, but I have to preach the Scripture the way they are, using the subjects I am learning here, Greek and Hebrew, and other subjects that I am learning. So that's what I am looking forward to.",What wisdom from wise men has benefited your ministry?,"There is a certain man -- he has been my help in many areas. Whenever I feel like things are not kicking with me, he sits me down and gives me counsel. He says, ""Don't give up. Don't give up."" So, with what I'm learning at CAPA, and with his counsel, I feel like I'm composing myself, I'm going forward. Sure.",What is your favorite memory at CAPA so far?,"First best memory I can possibly have for me is the very first day I came here during the interview days when I met Jim [Ayres] and I met Gideon [Manda]. Ah, the way they introduced CAPA to me and the way they welcomed me here. It was great! And I think this is one of the [most] memorable things I can possibly have in my heart. It’s something good.<br><br>
 
The other thing is the way we have been taught. It’s something that you cannot just throw it away. They are teaching us systematically… The lecturers are just… they know their job. They know the stuff. I’m loving it so much. Sure.",What has been your favorite class?,"Right now I’m picking on Greek. In the first semester, I was struggling so much. But right now I feel like I’m picking it up and I’m enjoying it now. So these two classes, I’m enjoying them very much. Sure.<br><br>

Also on the ministry, ministry studies. The pastoral ministry. In the first, it was taught by Gideon [Manda], second it was taught by Tony [McCracken]. It’s a course that I’ve enjoyed and is helping me even now. It is helping me how do I manage the church. How do I take the Word of God to teach it to the church. How do I handle smaller issues taking place in the church.<br><br>

In the church, there are different people, different class of people. Some are educated, some of them are not educated. Like in Malawi, you know education is a difficult thing. Now, in our church, in our local church, you find 90% of the people not educated. It’s only 10% that has the possibility of going to high school. Only 10%. Now, how do you handle the 90%, working together with these people of the 10%? So pastoral ministry has been helping me so much to work with them because it teaches me how to. That’s why I’m enjoying it. Sure.",What is one book that has impacted you this past year?,"The books are so many. There is another book — Colossians [Bible commentary], by [John] MacArthur. It’s trying to explain how you can understand the book of Colossians. You really see the flow of the book very well. It’s very different from way I used to study the book in the first place. You know, before I read Colossians, before I read this book, it was like, I know the book. But when I came across this book… oh, it has just opened my eyes. This is it! Sure. I’m enjoying the book.<br><br>

<strong>What is one thing you learned from the commentary?</strong><br>

One thing that I'm learning from the book is Paul is addressing some specific issues — like many people, like in Malawi, many people are teaching things contrary to the Bible. Like the worship of angels, the worship of some beings, some other things. So in the book of Colossians, that one is well expressed — say “don’t be moved by some other philosophies.”",How has CAPA influenced your family life?,"It has really done much. Right now, the way I relate with my wife is different from what I’ve been used [to]. There was an intensive class that we had. One week marriage and family [counseling] intensive class. It has really influenced my life, my family. Now we are relating very well. My children, things are kicking very well. Each of us knows our position, what to do, when and how. Because of some of the lessons that we are learning here.<br><br>

It’s like the man is not the boss. He’s actually the leader, not the boss, so to say. And the wife is not the object. No, [she] is co-worker, is fellow person that should be respected. Deserves respect, deserves every kind of right. And the children would learn from us parents and whatever we do, without telling them, they actually copy it —the way we handle ourselves. The children look at them, look at us, and say, “Yeah I think this is the way.” But if we misbehave or we treat each other wrongly, they even copy that bad behavior. And consequently, they’ll live the same life as they grow. So, really, I’m helped in that area. Very much.",Is pastoring a church still your ministry plan for the future?,"I don't have any other option. I feel God has called me to this ministry. And I'm very happy with it, despite all the challenges. Challenges are there. Wherever I go, I may have challenges. But one thing for sure — once I stick with what God called me for, I'm okay. I feel like church ministry is my calling. That's it. That's it. I'll be a pastor. Until Jesus comes. Sure.","If you could leave a word of encouragement to your fellow Christians in Malawi, what would you say","First thing is they have to understand the Word of God, and do the Word of God, not just hearing it. The book of James tells us we should not deceive ourselves. Hearing the Word of God is different, and doing it is another step. So many people know, possibly they have heard the Word of God. So they have to do the word of God. That’s the first encouragement I will possibly give.<br><br>

The second thing is — the people that are called to ministry, they should make every effort possible to go and learn at an institution that is really teaching the word of God. One of them is CAPA. That is my encouragement. This is very important because ignorance destroys a lot. The way I understand the Scriptures right now, and the way I used to understand it in the past, after coming to CAPA, is very different. So I encourage all those ministers across, go to an institution that is teaching the Word of God in the way it is, not put in some useless philosophies, but using the Word of God [to] interpret the Word of God.",,,,,,,,

Ernest Kanzangaza,What do you like to do when you have free time?,"When I have free time. I stay home, watch a movie, basically—oh, and read a book.
",What is your favorite memory at CAPA?,"Favorite memory at CAPA. Um… the first day when I entered class, Dr. Brian [Biedebach] telling us, ""Your coming here into CAPA is both a blessing and a curse."" You know, and he explained why it's a curse and why it's a blessing. That has not gone out of my mind this day.",Why is CAPA both a blessing and a curse?,"He said that because he knew that we were coming from a background that didn't really focus much on the Bible; we are kind of topical, and you know, without really looking into the Word and understanding what does it say, you know. So yeah, he explained it would be a curse because a lot of things we believed in will be challenged in this class. It will be a blessing because you get resources that will make you to stand out there and effectively teach God's Word.",What is one thing that has been challenged while you've been at CAPA?,"One thing I have been challenged by being in at CAPA is previously I would just look at a Scripture, jump with it, without really looking at the context and all those things which I've learned when I came to CAPA. So now, if I am asked, ""Oh, you are preaching next week,"" I need to give more time to the passage. Previously, I would do that even the morning on the day of preaching. I would just wake up, and ""OK, I will take this passage and I'll preach."" But these days, it's not, because I need to explain things in there. So that is one thing that has been really been challenged.",What has been your favorite class at CAPA so far and why?,"Oh! Oho! There are several though, but one class I can really mention is Greek. I've enjoyed Greek class. First because of the professor who [teaches] that class, he's one who's really been there encouraging us. And at the same time, the way Greek is structured as we've been studying it and again comparing it with the other [Bible translations] we've been using… yeah. It's so great.",What is one attribute of God that you've personally experienced this past year?,"His faithfulness, that God is faithful. It's not been easy to be in class every week — every module. It's not been easy. But since I started class, I've never missed a class. It's not by my own strength. No. I've never been in financial problems, maybe [inability] to pay school fees. I've seen His hand every day, every module. So… yeah, He is faithful.",What wisdom from wise men has benefited your ministry?,"When Pastor John Koh [Faith Bible Church], was here, he spoke about a plane, that it has to fly on two wings. And he spoke of prayer [<em>stretches out right arm</em>] and relying on the Holy Spirit [<em>stretches out left arm</em>].",How has CAPA influenced your family life?,"It has influenced my family life mainly through the class of counseling. It made me begin to realize what responsibilities I have toward my wife. There are moments to just look at family as a give and take issue, but when I was in that class, I [realized] no, it is about I giving. I need to keep on giving and giving and giving.",In what ways has the Lord grown you this past year? What has He been teaching you?,"One area He's been teaching me and is still teaching me is about faithfulness. His Word, His work, and to be faithful toward my family. You know, there have been times, I think, I have heard Pastor Jim Ayres saying, ""You know, your family is the priority. Even when you fail in class, but if your family is standing, that's the greatest thing.""",What are you looking forward to this year?,"This year, I am looking forward to learning new things. Now that we are to start Hebrew, I'm looking forward to understanding it indeed, so that I can be able to also understand how the Hebrew text was written, the context of it, so I want—my desire is that I can understand that language and be able to go through it fluently, if God willing.",What challenges have you faced in ministry?,"Challenge has been balancing school and family and work. Yes, I do my own thing with business so I'm able to organize my time, but during breaks, it becomes a challenge. Sometimes the school suffers one hundred percent because I just need to provide for my family, I've got customers to service, at the same time, I'm desiring the money to pay school fees… So yeah, to make all these things work, it's not been easy. But His grace has been sufficient, and here we are. Yeah.","What are your future plans for ministry, and did this past year change your future plans?","No, this past year didn't change my future plans. My future plan is to pastor a church where I can be able to see people grow by His grace, and getting established in the ministry as well. That's what I desire to become and to be. And I still pray that God will order my steps to that effect. Yeah.","Do you have a favorite textbook that you've used so far, and what did you learn from it?","Favorite textbook… <em>Idols of the Heart</em> [by Elyse Fitzpatrick]. It really challenged me. I read it, I think, twice. It really challenged me, because it was — it dealt directly with me. I was reading it, when it was dealing with [uprooting] anger in your heart. And I would begin to see, reveal myself, and yes, these things have been there and they're there indeed. Reading through that book, I came to realize that if God can't help me, and if I can't come to Him for help, I can't manage it. It has really challenged my life.","If you could leave a word of encouragement to your fellow believers in Malawi, what would you say?","I would say God loves us, but He hates sin. And His desire is that, going to the Scripture, that He wants — His desire is everyone should come to the knowledge of the truth. And Malawi is still open to the gospel, and we shouldn't abuse the opportunity that God has given us."
Nehemiah Kanzanthu,What do you like to do during your free time?,Always assisting people in terms of counseling.,How long have you been a pastor?,This is my eighteenth year.,In what ways has the Lord grown you this year?,There is nothing possible without God. That's an encouragement to me. Sure.,What has He been teaching you? Whether here at CAPA or through ministry?,"I think God has been on my side. It's throughout my life — whether in school, in church, in the home — I can see that God has really teach me a lot wherever we feel that maybe we cannot afford to go through, but God's grace. Sure.",What are you looking forward to this year?,"I'm still looking forward to learn more and more so that I can assist other people better. Because what I am doing right now is like… do you know a dove? Wherever has got some chicks, it goes outside to fetch for the food, and then feed the little ones. Whenever I'm learning something, I need to feed that message, that Scripture, that information, to the people. Sure.",What challenges have you faced in ministry?,"Since I've done a lot of years in schooling, my main challenge is like how to get funds to [pay for school] as well as to support the family. That has been my great challenge. Sure.",What is one way the Lord has blessed you through CAPA?,"Yeah, in terms of as a pastor, because we need to be excavengers, not just to be confident of what we are doing but we need to have more and more knowledge. We have to learn more and more so that whatever I've learnt, I have to share. It's not a single thing, but a number of things, whenever, whatever I find, I still share that. And people out there in the congregation, they feel happy and they grow so that they can reach maturity in their spiritual life. Sure.",What is something that you've learned here that has benefited your church greatly?,"We learnt today in the chapel about the leader. The leader has to be serving willingly, and he has to face all the challenges as a leader. He has to be strong, courageous, willing to serve so that even the members see the examples of a leader. So I try to see that the members I'm serving see why and how I'm doing that. So that really helps them to grow spiritually mature. Sure.",Can you tell us about some of the friendships that you have at CAPA?,"I'm really happy because now and again, each and every module, we are meeting different people, different lecturers, so that is adding my friendship in my memory, in my serving. Even my fellow students, those students, maybe had it been I didn't come to CAPA, I couldn't manage to be chatting with them or knowing them, but we are freely mixing, freely sharing, freely enjoying the CAPA material. Sure.",,,,,,,,,,
Stanford Kapanda,What's your favorite memory at CAPA?,"What I remember most about CAPA is the preaching lab. I remember we had a professor by the name Brian [Biedebach], [who] was teaching us. When he called me to preach during preaching lab, at first I didn't know what to do. It was as if I have never preached, yet I do preach at my church time and again. But with the style of preaching in terms of expository type of preaching, which is taught here, it's so rich, it's so vast in knowledge, so far that you are able to know more things and expound more things as you are preaching. So, I still remember those days.",What has been your favorite class and why?,"We are learning Greek, a subject which have never taught before. You know here in Malawi, the schools that teach Greek – I think is only CAPA that tries to teach Greek.",What is one attribute of God that you have experienced personally this year?,"Love. I've experienced the love of God. God has been so kind to me in a number of things. For example, the church which I'm pastoring – I've seen how faithful God is in terms of bringing all people, and also experiencing the people loving one another at church. I can say that indeed, God is love. He cares for me, for my family – divine provision.",How has CAPA influenced your family life and relationships?,"CAPA has influenced my family in terms of understanding one another. We have been learning a number of teachings concerning family, friends. For example, the issue of counseling in family. There are some books which I have shared together with my wife. After reading those books, [we] could see some change, learning something that has never learned before. I also have learned something that I have never learned before. And we share those things to our children.<br><br>

For example, even a book we have just received now that talks about shepherding the child’s heart. I like it so much because I have never, never go through that kind of teaching – that we should raise our children looking at their heart, or beginning from the heart. You know, sometimes, you could just treat them by dealing with the outside behavior. You see a child behaving this way or other, that way, and you try to mend, put that child in the line, but you find that it’s not changing at all. But as I have learned that a child is supposed to be taught right away by dealing with the heart first and using the Word of God, and then after, the child would be able to grow with the aspects of God.","In what ways has the Lord grown you this year, and what has He been teaching you?","I have seen great growth in terms of my prayer life and the way I've studied. CAPA teaches us more about knowing more about the word of God, so I have experienced Christ in terms of understanding the Scriptures. Even the prayer life, how important it is for a man of God to be in the praises of God. And how the man of God is supposed to study the Scriptures so that even before you go in front of the pulpit to share, you must be well aware. Yeah.",What are you looking forward to this year at CAPA?,"This year, I'm looking to learn more about Hebrew because I have never learned Hebrew, but it will be my first experience to undergo that type of subject.",What challenges have you faced in ministry?,"The challenge which I have faced is to balance the two: school and ministry. It’s a little bit tough because you are at school, you want to study, you want to write assignments, but at the same time you want to take care of the sheep. It is a great challenge.","If you could leave a word of encouragement to your fellow Christians in Malawi, what would you say to them?","I would like to say to them that I think they should not waste time. We need to know the Word more, and I would like to invite them to come to school at CAPA so that they can learn something about expository preaching.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Mayamiko Kuthyola,What is your hometown like? Are you from Lilongwe?,"Yes, I am from Lilongwe, so within the vicinity.<br><br>

<strong>What it was like to grow up in Lilongwe?</strong><br>

It’s been very challenging because I’d say I grew up in a Christian home and my family believed in Christ, [but] the area that I grew up in was not as good as I thought, you know. Growing up as a kid with a lot of peer pressure and a lot of people around me who are unbelieving, was not very good for me, but I’m really grateful for parents who are believing, who are still believing Christ. And they taught me a love of prayer when I was really young, and that really helped me growing up because I wasn’t very much associated with the people who were unbelieving, yeah, it just kept me away from troubles.<br><br>

<strong>Do you spend a lot of time with family outside of CAPA?</strong><br>

Very much. Of course, right now, I’ve moved out of my parents’ home, so I’m staying alone, but in as much as I have time, I make it possible to go and see them over the weekend. So, yeah.",What's your favorite memory at CAPA?,"My favorite memory. Umm, I'd say the day I got accepted to come and study with CAPA was one of the best memories that I have right now. And even the time that I saw the [Advanced Diploma] class graduating – it was one of the memories that I have in my head because I'd say it's a big thing to me, because it gives me hope, because looking at three years in the first place was like a really long time for me, but to see the first class graduating, it gave me some hope that there'll be a time that's going to come for me to also graduate and exercise what I've been taught here at CAPA. So graduation and me being accepted to study with CAPA are starting memories in my life.",What is one attribute of God that you've experienced this year?,"[<em>laughs</em>] I've experienced all attributes, but basically I'd say I've experienced much more of His mercy. God has been very merciful upon my life, seeing the way I live and how gracious He has been, all the way through my hard times and the times that I struggle. You know, we live a life full of evil, and I fall and get up, so His mercy's been very certain in my life. And to see how gracious He is, still loves me even though sometimes I behave like I don't love Him, but He still desires a relationship with me, and that keeps me going, and even motivates me to love Him more. So His love and mercy has been great in my life.",In what ways has the Lord grown you this year and what has He been teaching you?,"He has grown me so many ways. Especially this year, been going through some tough times, I'd say. But through suffering, I'd say He has helped me to grow in a certain aspect in my life, as in how I can handle issues. I know that someday, I may be a full-time pastor and I'll face a lot of trials and sufferings and how I can handle situations as a man of God [is important]. So He has grown me to be someone who has fear for Him. And at the same time, He has grown me to be a man who handles issues maturely, to react to whatever comes my way in a godly way, so that's how I would say He has grown me.","What are you looking forward to this year, at CAPA, in ministry, or in your personal life?","With CAPA, I’m looking forward to learn more. We’ve been given all of the materials to study, and I’d like to use the textbooks that we’ve been given to read them extensively, not only just for class or quizzes that we have, but to use the material so that they can even help me grow in my spiritual life.<br><br>

And outside CAPA, I’ve also been given more roles at the church to help with the youth, teach them, to help with children’s ministry. And all that looks like it’s going to be a heavy burden on me, but it’s going to shape me as well. So I’m looking forward to being very active in all these areas that God has given me an opportunity to serve him.",What challenges are you facing in ministry right now?,"I am working with the youth, and I am also helping with children's church. The thing is, we do not have enough people to help with those ministries, so that brings a lot of pressure on me, because if there are not a lot of people to teach or help out on a Sunday, then it has to be me who backs up or who works as a substitute. It's been very challenging to not have a lot of people sign up for such kind of ministries to help out, but by the going of time, God bringing people in church and people who have a zeal and passion to serve Him in those ministries, so I believe it's going to be fine.","What wisdom from men here at CAPA or church, has benefited your ministry and life?","I've got a lot of people who are spiritually growing my life. There's a lot of men in my life in different directions. Just to give an example, I've got Pastor Jim [Ayres], Pastor Matt [Floreen], Pastor Gideon Manda, Dave Temple – these are people who sit me down every now and again and ask me how I'm doing. And everybody has got his own area that he's touching in my life. So it's been very challenging in my life to have people who are spiritually mature and they can even help me when I'm struggling. But not coming in one direction, they are tackling different directions of my life, so it's so good to have them around, and they're challenging me a lot. And out of that I'm growing every day.","How has CAPA influenced your family life? Relationships with parents, with family?","Basically I would say, growing up, I’ve grown up as a Malawian, and in Malawi, I’d say people value their families very much, but not Biblically. So to understand how I can value family, I know that, but not in a way that that the Bible teaches us to value family.<br><br>

For example, let’s say I get married. I did not have much respect for marriage as much as I have right now. I should provide for my home, but I did not know that all that I should do. I should also create time for my family, as in not only do I have to provide for them through working and making money, but I have to be there for my family. If God blesses us with kids, I should raise them in a way that is honoring and pleasing before the Lord, so CAPA has helped me to see how I can respect or have respect for my family, and even love my family as God wants me to as a man.","How has one specific book influenced your thinking and living, and how has it grown you?","Recently, I was reading a book written by A.W. Tozer, The Attributes of God. So you just asked me what kind of attributes has influenced my life, like I’ve experienced it, it’s all attributes. So that book is teaching us the character of God or the qualities that God has.<br><br>

This book has helped me see the sovereignty of God in every single thing that happens in this life, whether good or bad.<br><br>

But one thing that I’ve understanded is that God does not [overlook] on things that are happening to me. What I’ve realized is that He sees every single detail of my life and He knows what is going to happen to me before it happens. Before it happens, He knows how He can take care of all those situations. So this book has really challenged me in terms of knowing the characteristics of God and how God used humans. So I don’t mean we can fully understand how He functions, because He is an incomprehensible God, but this book is just so amazing to help us understand how God works and his characters.",What are your friendships at CAPA like?,"I've created a lot of friends here. And I know that even after this, people will be my friends and will be like brothers who are in my life that I can rely on. Ministry, I believe, is not something that you can do on your own. You need other people, you need other men of God to help you work. And the moment you have people helping you, not only financially, materially, but just praying for you is enough to keep you going in ministry. So CAPA has brought a lot of people in my life that I know even when I go out, I've got people who can pray for me, I've got people who can check my life, I've got people who can just ask me how I'm doing, and they're there for me. So I really appreciate being at CAPA because it has exposed me to people that I did not know in my life.","If you could give encouragement to your fellow Christians in Malawi, what's one thing that you would say to them?","I think it can be a word of hope because we are very much privileged to have everybody else who has been coming to help us with learning and the teaching itself. Malawi is a nation that needs a church that is sound in its doctrine and its studies preaching the Bible. So in a long time, we have had churches which are just preaches something that’s not really from the Bible.<br><br>

And a message that’s hopeful and encouraging to Malawi is that n two, three years from now, the church will change, not as in fully, but as time goes on, the church will be changing in a good way because what we are learning here will be exercised in the churches up there. So Malawi should be hopeful and should be encouraged that the Word of God will be preached faithfully.<br><br>

And Malawi should be hopeful that our churches will not be the same. And I feel like the message has been despised in a long time. The Bible has been put aside and people preaching a lot of [other] things. So the message of hope is that Malawi would change for the better because CAPA is training pastors who are going to deliver the message that is coming from the Scriptures.",,,,,,

All types of stuff — writing books, reading books.",What is one attribute of God that you personally experienced this past year?,"I’ve seen God’s love in my life through the situations I’ve gone through. I remember I lost both parents, mom and dad, around — what was it — 1993. So from that time up to now, to be where I am, all I can describe is God’s love. God is caring, so good. So to me, it was like the end of the road, but I see that God is taking me from one level to another. So all I can say about God is about God’s love.",In what ways has the Lord grown you this past year?,"Spiritually. Yes, because remember that time when I had just lost my parents. In fact, because I was frustrated, I used to do all sorts of things which worldly people do. But when I met people of God, men of God, they preached to me, and I received Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, then from then — that was around 1993 — my spiritual life has never been the same. And also, when I received this opportunity to be at CAPA, my spiritual life has been changing from level to another.",What are you looking forward to this year?,"Well, as I am here at Central African Preaching Academy, in fact, what I am aiming at is maybe to further my education up to Ph.D level. In fact, as I am a full-time pastor, I am also a teacher at our school. We have something like a Bible school at our church, so there I do teach. So I see that if I am a teacher, and I am not qualified in terms of education and whatnot, I will not be able to help students in the right way. So what I am looking forward to is to reach that point of maybe having a Ph.D. So that is what I want to achieve in my life.<br><br><strong>Is there anything you are looking forward to this year specifically?</strong><br>This year… that is 2016. Well, it’s about ministry. Yeah, it’s about ministry. In fact, I serve God in the remote area, so there are different types of programs which we want to do there. For example, we are planning to buy land for the church, and just for your information, this coming Sunday, we are having the paper signed. All this is to get some funds so that we can buy land where we can build our church. So this year, this is what I want to achieve with God’s grace.",What wisdom from wise men has benefitted your ministry?,"There are different things which I have benefitted from wise people. For example, perseverance. You know, in ministry, we deal with people from different backgrounds, some very troublesome. So in fact, during some such situation, I have received counsel from men of God who have been in the ministry for more years than myself, so they have encouraged me to say, “No, go ahead. That is what you call ministry. There are all those types of people, so you need to help them so that they can be right people in the eyes of God, so just press on, never run away from the ministry to say, ‘Oh, this is too hard for me.’ No, no, no. Persevere, persevere, persevere.” So with that type of encouragement, I’ve seen, as time changes in my life, and also in my ministry philosophy, that ministry is all about God and His people. So these are some of the things I have learned from wise people.",What is your favorite memory at CAPA?,"Well, my time which I remember is the time we had a graduation last year, from [Advanced] Diploma class. So we had a graduation. So the event that took place there, you know, I still remember, and I have some pictures, so when I look at those pictures, I say, “Wow! This is great.” Sure.<br><br><strong>What excited you most about the graduation?</strong><br>In fact, the gowns, [laughs] which we’re using, very good gowns. And also, there was a choir that was singing, so that was also very, very good. And also, the preacher, who —I’ve just forgotten… was it Dr. —[INTERVIEWER: Rick Holland?] I think so, yeah. So the message that he preached was also very powerful. Yeah. So I still remember those things.",What has been your favorite class at CAPA so far and why?,"Ah, my favorite class at CAPA has been —I should talk of… In fact, there are many subject, which I have enjoyed, but homiletics class, especially expository preaching, because in fact, before I came here at CAPA, I had been preaching, but the way I was preaching was not good, in the sense that I was unable to expose the truth. So when I came here at CAPA, I almost repented that all the messages that I was preaching were not good messages because I was unable to pick the truth from the text. So homiletics has been the subject which I have enjoyed at CAPA. Sure.<br><br><strong>Do you remember an example of a text that you preached before you came to CAPA that was not a good sermon?</strong><br>In fact, yes, I remember, for example, parables in the gospel. For example, the parable that Zacchaeus, a short guy, climbed up in the tree. Yeah, wishing to see Jesus. So that one, I could just allegorize it to say Zacchaeus, being short--that is, shortness did not mean that he was actually short, it was because of sin, interpreting that when he went up into the tree, that tree represented the church — that a sinner cannot see Jesus if he is not in the church. So he has to be in the church so that he should see Jesus in all things. <br><br>

So when I learned principles of hermeneutics, then I discovered that no, that was not the real teaching, that is not the real message that is in that passage. So I saw that no, that was not a good message. So when I came here at CAPA, my eyes were opened. I saw for me to come up with message, I have to read, observe, and interpret, then apply, and also, I have also to go to the authorial intent, to ask myself, “Why did God put this in the Bible?” Then after getting that authorial intent is when I can come up with the right message, the right interpretation, and the right application. Sure.","What have you been preaching through at your church, and what has the main point been?","Well, for example, from last year, I’ve been preaching from the book of Romans. So because of the hermeneutic principles I have learned at CAPA, then I saw that I was able to bring out the truth. For example, the book of Romans talks about justification by faith. So I was able to bring out what Paul was trying to communicate to the Romans. Sure.",What are your friendships at CAPA like?,"Well, we have good friendships here at CAPA. In fact, we are people from different denominations, from different backgrounds. But when we are here, we are like people from the same family, from one family. This school has helped me to have new friends. In fact, some from Lilongwe, and some from different parts of the country. So when we are here, we are like children from one family. So the friendship has been very, very good. Sure.<br><br>

<strong>What denomination are you from, and who is a friend you have that is from another denomination?</strong><br>
I am from Living Christian Church, and here — when I came here, I have many friends. One of them is Alfred Goliath, and another one is Samson Cholokoto, and another one McJoster Malweni, Yohane Tembo, Patrick Tsiga. We are like a family! [<em>laughs</em>] Sure! Sure.
",How has one book you read this past year influenced your thinking and your living?,"Yeah, one such book is <em>Uprooting Anger</em> [by Robert Jones]. Yeah, you know, most people are struggling with anger, and one of them was myself. But when I read the book concerning uprooting anger, then it helped me greatly. So I have seen a very big difference in my life. I am progressing. I cannot say I am hundred percent perfect, but what I learned from the book is still helping me. And I hope it will change me completely with the grace of Jesus. So that’s one of the books. Sure.",How has CAPA influenced your family life?,"Well, my family life — there has been a great change. In fact, here at CAPA, we have lessons dealing with family relationship. So we have things like — there are many lessons that deal with family. We always have also things like dating our wives, so where you take your wife to a certain place and chat with her there, and discuss many issues concerning your home, family affairs, things like those. And also, be doing something to surprise her — for example, buying her a gift. All those things. So now, my family life has greatly also changed. In fact, I should say, CAPA is tackling all areas of life. Sure.",What challenges and joys have you faced in ministry?,"Well, one of the challenges is that as I minister in the village, so people — in fact, I do have some people who are still rooted in their culture. Their culture, that — there are some cultures that are not godly, so to uproot them from such cultures, it becomes a problem. Yes, they may come to church and hear the message. [Later,] you may be surprised to see the very same person come back to what he was doing before coming to the Lord. So that is one of the challenges. And also, financially. For example, as I am in the village, people in the village, many of them are just poor farmers. So when you want to come up with programs that will need money, for example, we talk about building programs. There is very little progress in programs like those ones. So these are some of the challenges I face, especially because my church is in the village. Sure. <br><br>One of the joys, which I have enjoyed in the ministry, is as we have already mentioned, is something to do with relationship. Yes. I have seen God bless me with good friends, I remember in pastor’s friend — because we have groups of pastors called “pastor’s fraternal” — there, we always meet as pastors, and discuss different things. And it is also like another family. So there are many things which I enjoy to be in the ministry. Sure.",Have your future plans for ministry changed since we interviewed you last year?,"Maybe I can say so that it has changed a bit, but not changing in the sense of maybe deciding to quit ministry or affecting my ministry negatively. Those changes are not affecting my ministry negatively, but positively. For example, I am a teacher also. At my church, we have a small Bible school where those people would not go far with education, so they cannot come here to learn English, because here, lessons are in English. So those people, they can only communicate in Chichewa. So I am teaching those people. <br><br>Then I see that because I am a teacher, I am also the registrar of that school. See that if I don’t go further with education, I will not be able to help those people properly. So then when I came here, saw that there is good stuff here, then I saw that no, I should not plan small but I should plan big, I should go further with education. For example, as I am doing my master’s degree, after I’ve completed this course, I am planning to go further with my studies to do a Ph.D. <br><br>So in fact, this dream was not there before I came to CAPA, but when I came to CAPA, there was some sort of hunger for school. So — and This hunger for school has come because of my coming here to CAPA. So I see that CAPA has also helped me to change my plans, because at first I was thinking — my vision was small. Maybe I [would] just came [study] here. When I heard that this had something to do with expository preaching, so I just said, “OK, let me just hear what expository preaching is all about.” So when I came here, it’s like, now my vision has now become wide. So I’m thinking of doing greater than what I was planning to do. Sure.","If you could give a word of encouragement to your fellow Christians in Malawi, what would you say?","Well, my encouragement to the fellow Christians in Malawi will first of all go to the pastors because there are many churches in Malawi. There are many pastors, but [some] just get up in the morning and say, “I’m a pastor.” So without having any theological knowledge, has never been to school or theology, and if he went to any school for theology, there was not something like expository preaching. So the messages that are preached out there are very terrible. So my advice is that maybe they should come to CAPA for them to be well helped, so that they can handle and divide God’s Word appropriately.<br><br>

And also to church members, I would also like to ask them to at least go to a church where the Word of God is rightly being preached because they may go to churches where they don’t know something to do with expository preaching. The messages which they receive there are very terrible to their spiritual life. So this can be my piece of advice to my fellow Christians in Malawi."

Julius Malewezi,What is one attribute of God you personally experienced this past year?,"I resigned from my job as a lecturer and vice registrar. So I've seen the hand of God regarding my financial position here at CAPA because I didn't have the resource of finance to pay for school fees, but rather seen God's hand in that I'm been able to finish the first year and now I'm in my second year, and God has been providing finances through various means, so I have seen the hand of God in that. God has been so, so faithful in his provision.",In what ways has the Lord grown you this past year?,"In the past year, He's teaching me quite a lot through CAPA. Also through ministry at home because we also have a ministry at home. We teach to the young children. My wife is also involved in that. And I've seen the ministry growing; yeah, it's growing. And my knowledge is also getting richer and richer, richer thinking is very useful and when I finish [school], I think I'll be fully prepared to serve the Lord.",What are you looking forward to this year?,"This current year — there are new subjects that we are taking like Hebrew, which is also challenging. Last year there was Greek, which I also struggled in the beginning, but later on, I picked up. I'm still struggling with Hebrew. These are very important subjects for us to understand the word of God. They are very important and I'm expecting that I grow in our strengthening up my abilities through these important subjects. So that's my expectation, that I'm going to improve, work hard, and I will do well in this year.",What wisdom from wise men has benefited your ministry?,"There's a [leader] at my local church who was actually helping me to get established. He mentioned that some strengths and, of course, some weaknesses, which I'm working on, because you know I'm new in the ministry and there's quite a lot I need to learn. So he told me to work on composure and to have confidence when I'm actually preaching and teaching. So that's what I'm working on currently and he's very supportive. So I get a lot of support from him.",What is your favorite memory at CAPA so far?,"Favorite memory, obviously, is the huge support that we are getting from the lecturers, particularly the lecturers that are coming from America that come to teach us each module. I think this… I will remember for the rest of my life, I think, because they are bringing valuable rich information, rich resources which I think is helping us quite a lot to developing us into mature pastors.<br><br>

<strong>Do you enjoy the lecturers that come from America to CAPA to teach?</strong><br>

Yeah! This is great, this is what has really attracted me quite a lot. I mean, I’m impressed with that, yeah. It’s a good arrangement, I think, a good program, because I don’t think there's any other opportunity that one can get from anywhere from currently Malawi. I think this is the only unique opportunity.",What are your friendships at CAPA like?,"You know, I’m quite reserved, that’s how I am. But I’m trying to develop some friendships. In my class, I have two or three people that I confide with. We assist each other, particularly in terms of the areas of theology and areas that I need support. So I get a little support from my friends. I think it’s a good relationship. That’s quite good.<br><br>

<strong>What are your relationships with the professors like?</strong><br>

The professors are really helpful. They are very helpful. They want us to obtain the necessary material, necessary information, knowledge, skills, so that we can develop, we can mature and assist the people out there because there is quite a lot that people do not know. And that will be very important when we go out to the local churches, when we have the right messages to deliver. I think that will be great if the whole Malawi is evangelized then that will be wonderful.",What has been your favorite class?,"Yeah, my favorite class now is Greek. [<em>laughs</em>] My professor has indicated to me that I have improved so much. So the subject that was not favorite, that was fearful… [<em>laughs</em>] later it [turned] to be my best subject. And also doing more on pastoral ministry, and as well as the previous Old Testament studies.",What is one book from this past year that has impacted you?,"There [was a] book that I have been interested really, which is about a pastoral ministry book that was written by J. Mac [John MacArthur]. So it was quite good book. It’s one of the best books I have read. Yeah, and it’s recommended for any pastor who is interested to improve in pastoral work.<br><br>

<strong>What is one thing that you learned from the book?</strong><br>

Yeah, one of them is the character, qualities of a pastor. Yes. I found them very useful. They’re well presented in the book. The characters of a pastor, so one can do self-eval [self-evaluation]. You can eval yourself whether you actually have those qualities of a pastor. That is very useful, that is very important. The qualities also — you can actually use them [for] your pastor, or even your wife to evaluate you, if in some areas you need to work on and improve. Because as you know, we have to grow; [all the] time we have to grow. There’s no one who knows everything. We are all the time learning. Every time we learn. So this is like a guideline for you to attain a level that you can really be confident you are mature enough to work for the Lord.",How has CAPA influenced your family life?,"Yeah. My family life is currently hugely influenced. Now every time that I’m doing something, I apply what I’m learning here. I’m applying to my family life. I apply to everything else that I’m doing. I think about that I want to talk about. So it’s a huge influence in terms of trying to do the right things, talk, speak the right things, think about the right things, and trying to assist also maybe my wife in terms of how she could look at life in general in terms of God’s sovereignty, God’s provision, and so forth. So it’s a huge influence.<br><br>

I discuss with my wife, and maybe a little bit with my sisters and so forth my relatives, trying to understand exactly what God wants us to learn from His Word. So this is one example. There are number verses in the Bible that I have picked up. I teach whenever I go to visit my sister. As we’ll discuss and trying to share what it exactly means. Yeah, so that’s what I think the best I can learn as quick as I can. That’s what I have planned, what I have been doing.",What are your future plans for ministry?,"Yeah, my main interest currently is on counseling. Yeah, particularly counseling in general, but marriage and family counseling in particular. Because I have realized there’s a lot that people don’t know about marriage and family life. Godly and biblical instructions, God’s instruction on marriage and family. So if God wills, I want to be involved in that so that we can develop a program in the church where we could be counseling people who have problems, or if they don’t have any problem they just want to know, to teach, to teach them about family life, marriage, and so forth.<br><br>

<strong>When did you start aspiring to marriage counseling?</strong><br>

Previously I was interested in teaching in general. But now, after going to the marriage and family counseling intensive course, then that interest has come up strong, because of the course. The course is quite good. It’s a very good class. So it was one of the intensives that we took in May at CAPA. So that’s when I started to develop that huge interest in family… Basically because of these two subjects at CAPA that have been huge impacts.","If you could leave a word of encouragement to your fellow Christians in Malawi, what would you say?","The hugest encouragement that I will give is they should stop loving the world. Do not love the world. 1 John chapter 2:15 down to 19, God is telling us, is commanding us not to love the world because the world, anybody who loves the world… the love of the world is not from the Father. It’s from the evil one. So I think that’s the huge thing I can encourage people about.<br><br>

People are so busy out there [doing] -- if you can use this word -- “useless” things. It cannot take them anywhere. It can only take them to destruction. So I think these verses in the Bible, in 1 John — this command, I found it very useful, and I think I will use it, including other Scripture, to assist people to look upon God. To help them in any way, in every way possible, because there is no purpose for live a life which is temporal. It’s better to live a life that is eternal.",,,,,,

If you want to learn, you must keep on repeating the things.",What has been your favorite class at CAPA so far and why?,"Marriage and family. Yeah.<br><br>

<strong>Has it impacted your marriage?</strong><br>

Yeah, very much, and in my church as well. I’ve changed my life – how I treated my wife, how I treated my family members, and how I can conduct the church, knowing that a strong church is made up of strong families, so I’ve been trying to teach the church, especially families in the church, how they can be strong so that the church can be strong.",What is one attribute of God that you experienced this year personally?,"God's provision – that God is able to provide all my necessities, even in terms of my school fees. Yeah.","What wisdom from wise men has benefited your ministry, from here or anywhere else?","Yeah, I've learnt a lot from wise men, like the saying that ""it's not over until God says it's over."" It has benefited my life a lot because whenever I am facing some challenges, I still believe in God to do something.",How CAPA has influenced your family life?,"I've been praying with my family. I've been reading Scriptures with my family. I've been sharing tips that I've learnt here with my family. So, [it] has benefited my family, and my church as well.",What are your friendships at CAPA like?,"I've learned that friendships are for keeps. What I'm trying to say is this: that if God allows us to be here, it is to help us, not only here, maybe after this place, we must assist or help each other to achieve some goals in life or in ministries. Yeah.",What is one book that has influenced your life and your thinking?,"The book, <em>Uprooting Anger</em> [by Robert Jones], just assisted me a lot. There was some piece of anger in my life before I read that book. But when I read it, and I was trying to practice what it read, it has assisted me a lot.",In what ways has the Lord grown you this past year?,"God has helped me advance in my ministry, even in my knowledge. I've learned how to understand the Scripture, how to interpret the Scripture, according to the original meanings like Greek. Currently, we are doing Hebrew. I think we'll learn a lot.",What are you looking forward to this year?,I'm learning to proceed with my studies as I improve my performance in class and my understanding of Scriptures. Yeah.,What are some challenges that your ministry has faced?,"Leadership and finances. Just some people – they are not faithful in their ministry, in their ministries. Finances in terms of assisting the church or the projects of the church, so it has been a challenge.","If you could give a word of encouragement to your fellow Christians in Malawi, what would you tell them?","I would encourage them to come to CAPA if they got a calling to serve God, because being here, they will be assisted in how they can read and understand the Scriptures and how they can put into practice in their lives.",,,,

McJoster Mwalweni,What do you like to do during your free time?,"My free time, especially when I just leave CAPA [after staying in the dorms during the module], I spend time with my wife and family. That’s first priority because we miss each other after two weeks.<br><br>Then also we have introduced the Leadership Training at our church so that also I’m involved in training leaders. We do it from Monday to Friday. The materials or resources and also their skills have came from CAPA. I go there and put more into practice, training leaders in different courses like Greek, preaching, also there’s English, and also there’s the New Testament and Old Testament — it's more like Bible overview — that we are getting from CAPA. So, I do that from Monday to Friday evening from 5pm up to 8pm.<br><br>Yeah, but from that, I’m also involved into youth ministry. I’m the director of youth. So sometimes also I’m involved with training the youth, gathering the youth, teaching them, and planning how we are going to do next time.<br><br>And also sometimes I, yeah, sometimes when I have free time, I like soccer. Also, I like reading especially like novels, newspapers, so I like that. I’m also involved in the singing music. Sometimes to church to sing with the youth and sing with the church choir.",What is one attribute of God that you have personally experienced this past year?,"One attribute of God is which I’ve really experienced is… God is omnipresent, which means He’s everywhere. When we are in problems, sometimes we found ourselves forgetting that God is with us. Sometimes when we are facing some challenges and difficulties we may think God has abandoned us. But through CAPA we were discussing about suffering, the doctrine of suffering, they really explained God is everywhere, is present. There is not any time or there is not any place where you can say God is not present. So, even if I’m here at CAPA, I’m meeting through some challenges or difficulties, for me, I believe that God is really still watching and He knows what we are going through.<br><br>And especially I am challenged with the love of God. One day when we were studying, I was trying to shake up the meaning of love. And that love of which God has to us is love without [partiality], unconditional love. He loves us when we are still sinners. And Jesus prayed that the love which is with the Father is the same love which we also have to do. It is really challenging because sometimes our love is limited. Sometimes our love is conditional, so it is a challenge to us.",In what ways has God grown you this past year? What has He been teaching you?,"This past year God has really shown me that I need to trust in Him. Especially I am saying this because of the experience that I’ve been encountering that looking to my income which I’m earning from the church and the support which I’m getting from the church. And especially the tuition which I am paying for CAPA, it’s not matching. But in all those situation I see the Lord working.<br><br>I see the Lord meeting my needs. I see the Lord taking care for my family, taking care of me. And also providing all the needs which really -- it humbles me that every time I need to trust Him. So, especially this moment God has humbled me that I’m able to trust in Him in all situation of my life.<br><br>Especially I’m coming from a background whereby even my relatives they are depending upon me. Like for the meantime, I’m also responsible for paying school fees for my brother. But at the same time, God is meeting our needs. God is able to provide us when here we are at CAPA. So in all such situations, for me, God is showing me that always I need to trust Him. I need to trust Him with all my heart and I need to depend on Him.<br><br>We are His own possession. In 1 Peter 2:9, where God says He chose us, we are His own possession. We are the holy people, the holy nation. We are the royal priest[hood]. So, looking into that situation, I’m sure to say when I have to face that situation, He’ll never abandon us.",What are you looking forward to this year?,"This year, I’m so excited especially since we’ve started Greek exegesis. We’ve done one class, but it seems there’s a lot to learn and I’m really waiting to see how I’m going to be equipped in terms of expositing the Word of God, finding the truth, and finding the meaning of the Scripture, because that’s what we communicate to the people.<br><br>Also, I was waiting for Hebrew. I’m also interested to see how God is going to humble through Hebrew. Yeah, because Greek is really challenging, it’s a really humbling subject. And also I’ll be humbled through Hebrew. So I’m eager waiting how I’m going to learn Hebrew.",What wisdom from wise men has benefited your ministry?,"Okay, first of all, I need to start with the faculty here at CAPA. They are really helpful in terms of when you have a problem or have a question that they come in and they really find the ways and the means to come and help you. That also teaches me to say: as a pastor, it doesn’t mean that I know everything. I need also other people who can help me and can teach me.<br><br>Also what I’ve been helped [in] I also need to go and help other people. God uses other men to support also His own people. And also God uses other men to equip His own people. That’s what I’ve seen, because the way [professors] are coming from America, coming here, equipping us. They are also spending a lot of money just to come and equip us which is really humbling. Which means for me I need to sort of offer myself to the Lord that God should use me as He is using others to help me. So, He should use me to help other people.<br><br><strong>Do you recall any specific advice?</strong><br>Yes! In two occasions. The first time I had Jim [Ayres]. There was a problem at our church. There was some conflict and that caused our church to be divided. So for me, as a new minister, I was just maybe a month into the church, and I find that church is a mess. So I tried to ask for advice from them and Jim gave me a very good advice, also together with Matt [Floreen] through biblical counseling. [Matt] also gave me good advice to say, “If you are to help people with problems who are in conflict, first you need to target to the heart because the source of everything is the heart.” Also Jim, he said to me, “When you are tackling the issues, you shouldn’t tackle those issues as a group, but you need to see each issue individually.” So when I heard from those advice and apply those advice as I’m talking now, I feel the church is coming together.<br><br>Also there was a moment, when I was really struggling in finances, that was also affecting my academic tuition in terms of class. When I approached Jim, he also encouraged me. He said that: “What you need to do is just be consistent. If you see that there are much problems or challenges, sometimes it is really good for you to put priorities. Have priorities in your life. Which is the first and which comes second? So if there is any priorities, target those priorities and the rest should come later.” That was advice that really helped me to put things in order, to do things according to the way things are supposed to be done. So that was advice that really helped me. ",What is your favorite memory at CAPA?,"What I love much about CAPA is the focus on Bible. I’ve been in different schools. This is way better. This is my second school in terms of Bible knowledge. CAPA is far much better. The way now I’m preaching now has really changed. So, also in terms of tuition, CAPA is better because in Malawi, many schools, they are very, very expensive. Sometimes it is difficult for them. It is not affordable especially for the people who can’t find money. They can’t find [money], or can’t find [space to enroll]. But I love CAPA because they try to support [pastors].",What are friendships at CAPA like?,"CAPA has helped me to broaden my fellowship with other people. So CAPA has helped me to add more brothers in my life; it also helps us to serve one another.<br><br>It also gives us [opportunities] to practice what we are learning, especially in the area of how to respond when you are in the group, when you are meeting different challenges. The good thing with our group is we are not from the same denomination. Some, they are Pentecostals, while others they are Presbyterians; like me, I am a Baptist. So coming together, sometimes it is really difficult. But CAPA has really helped to mold us and put us together and has really helped us on how we can still [be with] another person who is in another denomination, but still we can relate to one another as brothers.<br><br>For instance, all of us, no matter what denomination — what CAPA is bringing us together is [reminding us] we are, all of us, saved by the same grace, we are saved by the same God, we have the same faith. If we are believers, we are destined to eternal life which also brings us together rather than focusing on our differences.",What has been your favorite class at CAPA and why?,"My favorite class. I can mention maybe two. The first thing is Greek — always humbling, challenging, but I have loved it. Because Greek, I’m able to see a lot of information which maybe in our English are not there. And when I’m comparing Greek and especially like here in Malawi, we are preaching in Chichewa and our Bibles are in Chichewa, so when I’m comparing the Greek, you find that there's a lot of information that are not really there in Chichewa. Also some [information] are missing even in English. But in the Greek, most an eye-opener, I’m able to see the real meaning of the text which God intended to communicate to us.<br><br>The other subject is expository preaching — preaching lab, preaching class. I’ve been preaching for some time. Maybe started preaching when I was — we call it here Form 2, which is high school, as you say. For me, I was saying I was preaching. But when I came to CAPA, I found that preaching is more like saying what God said. If you are not saying what God is saying, it means that you are not preaching the Word of God. So through this class, preaching class, they’ve really helped me on how to understand and how to get the real meaning of the text, and how to apply that text in my life, and how also to apply that text to preach that text to the other person.<br><br>Like the way I was doing in the past was more like, when I read the passage, I would just go and preach maybe without understanding it and without applying it to my life. And even the selection of the passage, it was very different. I remember one of our lecturers say, “It is not me choosing the passage, but the passage is choosing me every Sunday!”<br><br>Another class is counseling. Because as a pastor, you can’t run away from counseling. Always there are people, always there are problems, and always there are issues to be handled. When I [started pastoring at my] church, there was an issue which was really difficult. People over there were scattered. People over there were divided. But through this Biblical counseling, it really helped me on how to handle that situation with the help of God, with the wisdom from Him. They are teaching us how to help the person because sometimes when a person presents an issue, we are focusing much on the issue on which he or she has presented, forgetting what is the cause of those things which is the heart. So through counseling, I’ve really been helped so far as pastoring is concerned.",How has one book you have read this past year influenced your thinking and living?,"Yeah, this time I’m reading on <em>Sweethearts</em> [<em>for a Lifetime</em> by Wayne Mack]. It’s a wonderful book. It talks about marriage — what is marriage really about. It has really changed my thinking. In the specific area which I was so impressed is about how they have explained Genesis 2:24, where the man shall leave and he shall cling, and the two shall be one. The way they have explained in Sweethearts — it’s really amazing. There’s a lot in terms of leaving, a lot in terms of cleaving, and a lot also in terms of one body.<br><br>

And also there’s another book which is <em>Shepherding a Child’s Heart</em> [by Ted Tripp]. There’s a specific example which when I was reading comes to my mind. It says: When two child, they are fighting for a toy. Another one is fighting, wanting to grab the toy which his friend had. Maybe the other family will ask a question, ”Who had it first?” which is the wrong question. But the question is supposed to be — both of these kids have problems. This one doesn’t want his friend to enjoy the toy the way he is able to do it. And also the other wants to take it because he feels he needs to enjoy it. So yeah, shepherding the child’s heart has also helped me as a pastor, not only that, but also as a father. 
",How has CAPA influenced your family life?,"My family life has really changed. In my case, maybe I’m a little bit — I have an advantage because I married in 2013. That’s when we had our wedding. But I joined CAPA, maybe a year after that. So it’s like the whole of my marriage has been shared by CAPA. Yeah, because at first, we had that dating class [a lesson in “Pastor’s Home” class]. Oh! It was really nice — taking my wife to the lake. We were there trying to chatting which was very strange to me. But it has really helped us.<br><br>And also not only that. For me, I know that I’m a man. I’m the head of the family for most of the families here, I can say in a village, the man — if he is leading, he is leading with power and oppression. Maybe sometimes the men treat women as slaves, property because we are doing this dowry, where the man pays the price to get him a woman. So they [think] like they buy them.<br><br>But what I’m getting from CAPA, we are able to practice with our family. We are able to teach one another. We are able to help one another. How can we improve each other. Each has done something which is really not good. My wife, we are able to apologize and ask forgiveness. The way I approach her is different with the way I was doing. And also the way I see my wife, I don’t see her maybe as an opponent or slave, but I see her as a helper who can really help me and we can serve together. Because in our culture, sometimes they say don’t trust your wife because she can kill you any day. So through CAPA, we find that — “Oh! My wife is the best partner which I can have in my life because that is the one God has created, [my] half for me.” Yeah, so through CAPA, I can say my family has been shaped in a very good way, yes. ",What challenges or joys have you faced in ministry this past year?,"Some of the issues which became more like a challenge is fees, tuition. It doesn’t mean the tuition is high comparing to how much education fees is going on nowadays. It became a little bit of challenges, a difficulty, but we thank the CAPA faculty because they introduce the work-study which really is helping to cover [tuition].<br><br><strong>Are you doing work-study right now?</strong><br>Yes, I’m going to continue to do my work-study. I see that as one of the means God is using [to provide].<br><br>The other challenge is like distance. I’m coming from Mzuzu [about 350 kilometers away], so also that contributes to the challenges in terms of finance because coming here needs some transport. Not only transport, but also coming here, I need to find some resources to leave with my wife. As family, I cannot leave her without anything. So yeah, finding money and finding means and ways on how to fundraise, to raise all the money can be challenging. We see also God intervening in such areas that He is able to support us. ",What are your future plans for ministry? Has it changed since last year?,"Not much changed, but maybe just continue to add a little bit on that. Many people [call themselves] pastors. I need to focus on training other people. As I’m talking now, we’ve already started doing the evening studies, the evening training. We are training other men, like especially elders of the church, on how to preach, how to preach faithfully, and to do expository preaching.<br><br>And also, it’s also my wish, if possible: I need to be writing some books. Many people there don’t have much books written in our language like Tumbuka, Chichewa, and other languages. Most of the books which have been written are English, while most of the people whom we are serving are — they can’t read English. They can’t understand English. The need of writing the books in our own vernacular language. If possible, if God allows, I’ll also need to do that. Especially, I’d really be able to help since I have knowledge of Greek and have knowledge of Hebrew. It’ll mean I’ll be writing biblical truth into vernacular language.","If you could give a word of encouragement to your fellow Christians in Malawi, what would you say to them?","I’m preaching through 1 Peter and I’ve been so encouraged how Peter is exhorting Christians how to live especially among suffering and going through oppression and trials. What I can encourage people is whenever we are facing temptations, whenever we are facing trials, whenever we are facing sufferings, we need to focus on God. We need to trust God. At the same time, in 1 Peter 2:21-23, Peter is exhorting the Christian to take Christ as an example. When we have suffered, if we are facing trials, we need to see how Jesus responded to different situations. We also need to respond in the same way. As believers, we are the chosen people. God has chosen us and we are His own possession. So because of that we shall not lose our hope. We should not lose our trust in Him. When things are going not according to our plan, we need to still continue to trust in Him because God’s timing is the best in our life.",,

Kondwani Nyanda,What do you like to do during your free time?,"If I have free time. [<em>laughs</em>] Yeah, I have some free time. I don't know, really. But I like playing soccer -- you call it soccer. Football. We call it football here. And that's what I like. Oh, if I'm not playing it, I have to be watching it. So, my free time is watching and playing soccer.",What is one attribute of God you personally experienced this past year?,"I think His faithfulness. He’s been very faithful to me and my family. I am involved in church plant, and one thing I have observed is that, when you are trying to plant a church like we are doing, which is not a Pentecostal church, not a charismatic church… in here in Malawi, it is not a very easy thing. It is very difficult. ‘Cause you are going against the tide. Cause everyone else is expecting something, you know. Everyone else is going out for miracles, prophets. And you are going the other way, you’re just telling the people let’s go back to the Word of God. Sometimes people look at that as boring.<br><br>

So the growth is very slow, and also, when the growth is slow, sometimes the resources are very minimal to carry us to go, to move forward with work. So that has been a challenge. Like, there have been times when we do not have enough, you know, to sustain us as a family. One thing I have been so grateful to God is that He’s been faithful. He’s always been there for us. He’s been, like, providing for us when we need it. There’s not been a day that I can say that we have gone to bed hungry. And I’m coming to school here, and I’m able to pay my tuition, you know, which some of my friends are struggling [to do]. But God has just been very faithful. So if there’s a thing that I can point at, it’s God’s faithfulness. For my life, and for that of my family.",In what ways has the Lord grown you this past year?,"Just what I learned more is the trust in God has not been that easy to grasp. You know, it’s easy to learn about trust in class. It’s easy to preach about trust. It’s easy to read and get excited about the topic of trust, but when it comes for you to practically live it, it’s not easy. So difficult, you know, because it’s… sometimes you look at it like, I might need to go through this, so the Lord has allowed me to grow in this area of trust in the Lord more.<br><br>

But also another part, I can say, is the part of holiness. The Lord has developed in me to fear Him more and more. It’s one thing that I can look back and see that the Lord has been showing Himself more to me, who He is and how He should be worshipped and how He should be feared. Because I really didn’t know what it means to fear the Lord. My understanding of the fear of God was not what I think it should be.<br><br>

So those are the two areas that I can point at. He’s still teaching me. He’s not done with me. But the two are really outstanding for me. Yeah.<br><br>

<strong>You mentioned how your understanding of the fear of the Lord has changed. How has it changed?</strong><br>

Good. You know, fear for us is like [we] fear dogs. Like here in Malawi. People, we fear dogs. It’s not like where you guys are come from, that dogs are friends or something. [<em>laughs</em>] You know, we’ll have this sign “beware of dogs” here, and if you see a dog, you are so afraid. It’s like a lion, you know, you don’t -- [a] lion has to be feared, you know? So that’s how I looked at God. I was afraid of him. So if you are afraid of something, it doesn’t mean you respect it. It just means you’re afraid of what it's going to do. So if there’s a way that you can run away from that thing, you are safe, so the lion can be passing outside your house — if you’re inside, you’re okay. If you hide from it, then you’re okay.<br><br>

So that mentality of fear of God is not good, because sometimes you will think, well, I’m not at church, nobody is watching me. Or I’m not preparing a sermon, so I can do this. But God is everywhere. He needs to be worshipped. He needs to be feared. He has to be, I think, honored, and respected, and to look at him as God, you know. Like that has been how I have grown to understand the fear of God. He’s there. He’s watching. And He is, um, is to be worshipped in that way. So that’s how, say, in short, as I am understanding about the fear of the Lord, you know. He doesn’t need any classrooms and boundaries. He’s there. He’s everywhere, and whatever I do in secret, He sees it. So the best way of looking at him is to see him as the God who does that, He’s everywhere. Yeah.",What are you looking forward to this year?,"Hebrew. [<em>laughs</em>] I don’t think I’ve done well in Greek, but I’m looking forward to Hebrew, you know. ‘Cause I don’t think I have preached enough of the Old Testament. I have always tried not to preach the Old Testament. Or even my own devotions, the only book of Old Testament that I have [been] familiar with is the book of Psalms. But these are the books that I feel like, “Why are these books in here?”<br><br>

But I think Hebrew will open that for me. And because it will grow in me the interest of studying the word of God even more. And I have done Hebrew before, but ... this time, it will be different because right now I am a pastor, and I am a family man of God. I’m a husband and a father. And all these things, I'll have to apply them to my own life. My own family. And I want to teach my family the Old Testament. So I think Hebrew will help me with it.",What wisdom from wise men has benefited your ministry?,"I’ve learned a lot from these guys, from these friends the Lord has placed me with. Mainly, my friend who was instrumental in the study of history in this school, Brian [Biedebach]. I’ve learned a lot from him, and I think one thing that I have learned is never to give up. I don’t know how many times I think of giving up on this school. But when I think of how much he advised me — why it’s not good to give up. I’m very thankful for him.<br><br>

And also on the fact that when you are planting a church, it’s not going to be easy. You know, his words say that don’t expect it’s going to be easy, and hang in there. You know, and he said that probably, it will take two years for you to experience a growth, or maybe three or maybe four. You just have to stay there and be faithful in doing what you are doing.<br><br>

And also one of the things that I learned from Brian is [you’ve] got to be faithful in preaching the Word. If I am faithful in preaching the Word, the Lord is going to bless the preaching of the Word. So those are the things that I have learned from Brian.<br><br>

There are many other guys also who have impacted my life. Every time when I hit the wall, I go back to them to ask for wisdom, and I am grateful for the brothers in Christ.",What is your favorite memory at CAPA so far?,"Since I am still here [<em>laughs</em>], I think just being together with these guys is just a wonderful experience, &lsquo;cause, you know, most of these guys I never thought of being in same class now seated at the same desk with me. Some of these guys have got huge ministries, you know, like they're pastors of big churches, and they are respected quite a lot out there. And just sit down with them in the same classroom. It's just, you know, an amazing thing. So that will always stick out for me as a memory, and just the fellowship among us, and you know, that's what CAPA has done — it's to bring all of us together, as pastor[s]. And I think, by the grace of God, if we graduate, I think this relationship is going to grow to a point where our churches can interact as well.",What has been your favorite class?,"Preaching. Anything to do with preaching. And… don't ask me what is not my favorite. [<em>laughs</em>] I'd say Greek is not my favorite. But it should be my favorite, but it's difficult. But I love -- every time I am in class and there's a professor teaching us on preaching, I like that. Because I think that's what we need here in Malawi right now. We need the faithful preaching of the Word of God. So anything pertaining to preaching is my interest. Like right now, we're going to have the preaching practicum. That's great. It's difficult because you preach and they criticize you, but they are perfecting you, and I like that.",What is a book that has had an impact on you?,"Yeah, um, I think ""Shepherding the Child’s Heart"" by [Ted] Tripp, is it? I think it’s called that. ""Shepherding the Child’s Heart."" It’s teaching us on how we can be good parents in our homes. So I think, since I got married, my perspective has changed. I want to be a better husband. I want to be a better father. I want to nurture my children, my own children, [and for] my kids to not experience what I experienced when I was growing up. I want to be there for them. I want to instruct them, teach them. So that book has been great, you know.<br><br>

And there was another book that we read when we did biblical counseling. I just forget the title. But that was also good book. Was it ""When Helping Hurts"" [by Corbett and Fikkert], or something like that. It was a really practical book that was teaching us how we can be good at, helping one another, and also how we can be a blessing to each other.<br><br>

<strong>So, the book, Shepherding Your Child’s Heart -- what was one thing that stood out to you?</strong><br>

My favorite part is when he is emphasizing on dealing with the heart of a child, not their faults, you know. How is the heart of my child? Once the heart has been dealt with, then probably the fruits are going to be good. But when the heart is not dealt with, maybe the fruits are not going to be as fruitful as they should. So most of the times, when we, as parents, we try to just deal with the symptoms, and not the root, so, that’s what I think the author is trying to emphasize.<br><br>

And also, in the part of helping a teenager, like I’m going to have a teenager next year. My son Warren is twelve. So next year, he’s thirteen. It’s always been scary, you know -- how do I help him? How do I nurture him right? As I said, I don’t want him to grow up the way I grew up, without proper guidance. So that book has stood out for me in reaching out to the children, and also to me as a parent, in how I should do that in love, you know, so yeah.",What are your future plans for ministry?,"I think my future plan right now is just to see myself preaching faithfully the Word of God. If I am not preaching, I would like to help others do that. Just to help their preaching skills. I don’t see myself as a teacher, but if the chance comes that I should teach, I can do that. But mostly, I would like to disciple some people, young people, so that they can develop the habit of preaching faithfully the Word of God.<br><br>

Why is that? Because here in Malawi, right now, we are faced with this challenge that people really don’t value preaching, because of the way we have grown up, like, we grow up listening, really, I’d say stories, you know. And those stories are sometimes really touching, and then those stories sometimes will lead us into feeling sorry about ourselves, and then that’s how it is. But to look into the Word and see what God wants us to learn, that is what we need to improve a lot. My future plan is to see, you know, young people growing in that kind of a culture, you know, like that kind of desire to preach faithfully God’s Word mainly those who have got a desire to be pastors and leaders in the church. Yep.<br><br>

<strong>Would you consider youth ministry?</strong><br>

Yeah, I think, right now, I don’t really think much about the youth ministry because our church is very small. But I really would like -- I mean, one of the things I would like also to do is to move in colleges and start some Bible study groups, so that these guys in college can start learning more about these truths while in college, so when they finish, then wherever they go, they can continue spreading what they have been taught in college, yeah.","If you could leave a word of encouragement to your fellow Christians in Malawi, what would you say?","I would say that, at this stage, I would say that people should be careful who they have as their pastor. They should not just take anybody to be their pastor. That would be [my word of encouragement], if I had the platform to warn the people of Malawi, which I don’t think I have now. But mainly to Christians in this country, I would say they should not just pick up anybody to be their pastor. They should make sure that he meets the qualifications, as we read in 1 Timothy chapter 3.<br><br>

You know, what is happening here is that you see some men who consider themselves to be pastors, but you look at their character. You look at how they live, with their families, in the society, in the communities, their neighborhoods, you don’t hear good stories about them. Yeah, they’re still valued as pastors, as if being a pastor is this thing that cannot be taken out, you know. But if there are qualifications, there should also be disqualifications, you know.<br><br>

So, it all lies with the Christians, the believers themselves, and for them to be careful. To know who is their pastor, they should read the Word. They should develop the culture of reading God’s Word. Because in there, in the Word of God, that’s where all these truths are coming out. At this stage, really there’s a lot of work to be done with our people here. But if I had to warn and encourage them, I would say, they just don’t have to follow everything. They have to really pray that the Lord is going to send them leaders who are passionate about the Word of God.<br><br>

<strong>So right now, how do you think people usually choose their pastors?</strong><br>

There are two, there are a couple ways. We’ve got churches that are denominational, and we’ve got schools, denominational schools, where they send their men, or, where they train their men. And these schools, when you graduate, they would just allocate. So whether you like him or not, as long as he’s been allocated by the denomination, then you’re just going to have him. That’s how the mainline churches here in Malawi appoint their reverends or ministers or pastors.<br><br>

And there’s another way, that somebody just wake[s] up and say[s], “I’m going to be a pastor.” And he has six people and you start a church. And then when that is done, no one can take you out. It’s your estate, you know. It’s your estate, it’s your church. And that’s not biblical. I mean there’s no accountability, no oversight. Nothing. And then when you are growing, maybe by the grace of God, the church is growing, then you want to find somebody. You as an individual, you’re going appoint someone to work with you, or to send him to another [church]. That is what is common.<br><br>

But I believe the church belongs to Jesus Christ. And He has left for us steps as to how it should be organized and how it should be done. I think we have just to follow that. And that’s normally what’s happening today in our country here. You know, I’ve heard in other countries, you know, they’ll invite a pastor, they’ll interview him, they’ll listen his sermons, they’ll scrutinize. They want to be sure that they’re really finding a man who’s taking care of the church. But that doesn’t happen here, you know. And I pray that maybe with the coming of CAPA, some of the things will change. That the Christians themselves, they will desire to have biblical leaders amongst them.",,,,,,,,

Yohane Tembo,One what is one attribute of God that you have personally experienced this past year?,"A lot. But one I can talk about, His sovereignty. Yeah, He has been so good to me yeah.<br><br>I’m doing school and my wife is doing school [for biblical counseling], and my first daughter is doing school, so God has been providing school fees for us, food, and shelter. Yeah, and for the past year I’ve never been sick, my wife has never been sick, my children have never been sick, so it’s God sovereignty, yeah.",In what ways has the Lord grown you this past year? What has He been teaching you?,"There are a lot of things, one of which is humility. Yeah, going through the Word of God and then looking at how God has His things and you are humbled. Yes.<br><br><strong>Is there a passage in the Word of God specifically that has really humbled you?</strong><br>Yes, Galatians 5:1. It talks about it is for freedom that Christ has set us free so we should not go back to bondage again. Yeah.",What are you looking forward to this year?,I’m constructing a church. It’s a big church project so I’m trusting in God that this year we finish this project. We started last year.,What wisdom from wise men has benefited your ministry?,"A lot of things. One of it is to just to be a servant of God — a faithful one and committed to the Word of God. And the slogan is, “If you don’t start it, you don’t see it.” So if you trust God for something, start it and you see God taking you through it, yeah.",What is your favorite memory at CAPA?,"When I was in the [Advanced] Diploma class, there were a lot of things that I could not clearly understood and that was bringing a lot of tension between me and the teachers. So, I called that as memorable time because it was when I discovered that “I don’t know.” Yeah.",What are your friendships at CAPA like?,"Oh! It’s like a family! Everybody is a friend. We are growing together as a family. So, the relationship is good, yeah. It’s like now I have a group of people that I can call brothers and that I can look up to them, I can talk to them, even things concerning my personal life, yeah.",What has been your favorite class at CAPA so far and why?,"Counseling, yes. Because in Malawi, we deal with a lot of family issues. So, of which in the first place, it was more like when somebody brought to you a family problem, we just go like, “Let me pray for you, let me pray for you.” But this time now, it’s not [just] that. So the counseling class has taken me through a process of understanding that the root of all problem is the sinful nature that we all possess. So, we deal with the heart, not the behaviors or the actions of the other person. So it has been really an eye-opener to me as a pastor, yeah.",How has one book you read this past year influenced your thinking and learning?,"There are many books I have read from CAPA, but the one that has left a big mark upon my life is <em>Uprooting Anger</em> [by Robert Jones]. At times, you think you don’t have anger, but then you go through that book. You begin to realize that we are all struggling with anger in one way or the other. So, that book has been so helpful to me. So, you begin to look to your own heart and your own motives and then you begin to grow trust in God, yeah.",How has CAPA influenced your family life?,"I’m loving my wife and my kids, yeah. Traditionally, Malawian people, we are not so close with our wives and children. But going through the CAPA lesson classes from the [Advanced] Diploma class to the Masters [of Divinity] class, I have been helped to be closer to my wife and my children.<br><br><strong>Does your wife notice the difference now?</strong><br>Yeah! A lot! She always say it would been much better if before I married her, I found CAPA first. [<em>laughs</em>] Yeah, because I’ve been married now 16 years. Yeah, so that has been so helpful. Like that tip we used to have in Diploma class, we were taught to have some dating with the wife — going out, having a walk, and giving some feedback [to each other]. So it really brought the two of us close and that is what also helped my wife to go on to study Biblical counseling. Sure.","What challenges or joys have you faced in ministry this past year? ","The challenge is that combining school and ministry… it’s hard work. Looking at -- you have sermons to do and you have also to shepherd the church, so that becomes like a challenge but the joy is that with the training, CAPA has helped me. I am now into expository preaching, of which I didn’t do in the past. I was more like topical preacher. But now, I’m doing expository preaching -- like right now, I am preaching through the book of Revelations after finishing through the book of Colossians and the book of James.","If you could give a word of encouragement to your fellow Christians in Malawi, what would you say to them?","I would say that there is a need to get a proper training as far as ministry is concerned. And one word, one more sentence I can say is that the best way to preach is expository preaching, yeah.<br><br><strong>What about to an everyday Christian in Malawi?</strong><br>Life is all about glorifying God. Everything that every Christian has to do is not for personal qualification or benefit, it is to the glory of God. That is what I can tell to every Christian. Whether they are doing business, they have to do it to the glory of God. Whether they are in sports, whether they are in school, whatever they doing, they have to do it to the glory of God. ",,,,,,
Martin Thom,How has CAPA changed your pastoring at your church?,"Yeah, I've been a pastor for a while, but I think CAPA has greatly improved my skills to preach and understanding of the Scriptures. Yeah, I'm a better person, I'm a better preacher, I'm a better man because of what God has done to me through CAPA.",Can you give an example of something that you preached before that wasn't like the sermons you preach today after coming to CAPA?,"Well, I think I've been at CAPA for a year now, but I think, looking back, once again listening to the members of the church, everybody testifies that my preaching so far is [richer], full of Scriptures and life. And there are a number of instances which time will not allow me to explain. But other than that, suffice it to say that personally, I see that there is a great change, in the richness of the text of the Scriptures, the preaching, the confidence and all that stuff, so it's all because of what God has done through CAPA.",Have you seen a lot of change in the members of your congregation?,"Yes, there is a great change. There is a great change. I think there is a lot of desire to hear the Word of God, to know Christ more, so there is a great change in my personal life as well as the lives of the members of the church.",What's one thing that you studied at CAPA that's been extremely impactful for you?,"I think with Pastor Brian [Biedebach], we did quite a lot of homiletics, and that has really transformed my life. But with Pastor Tony [McCracken], on pastoral ministry, that again has been such a great wealth. Again, with Pastor Jim [Ayres], just understanding the Bible from the Greek concept, again that has really helped me. But again if you talk of family and counseling, these are some of the subjects that have really impacted my life. But again, the visiting professors have been such a great, good blessing. So most each and every subject has been life-transforming. We go there with the mind to embrace the truth, to be impacted and changed. So yeah, almost all the subjects have been such a great treasure.",How has the material being taught at CAPA impacted your family life?,"I think, more specially, it has enlightened my eyes in terms of understanding the Scriptures, how to apply the truth to your personal life, and again be able to be the kind of father that God would want you to be to your children, the kind of husband God would want you to be to your spouse. So that has really helped me quite a lot.",Can you give an example of how your relationship with your wife and children has changed?,"You know, [in] the African culture, the man is like a king. That is basically the African concept. But then you come to CAPA, you learn about God has made a man to be the head of the family, but not the boss of the family. So these are some of the things that have really helped me to change, to understand that my wife – she is my spouse, she is my helpmate, not necessarily being boss over her, but at the end of the day, a colleague.",How else has God grown you this year,"I think God has grown me in terms of humility. Greek really humbles you. The deception may be thinking you know everything, but then coming to CAPA, you sit down with your friends and colleagues, and see people who can do better than you, and then you are challenged by the professors when they stand in front and preach the Word of God and then you find out that you are not yet there [at that level]. So, I think humility has been quite a challenge – to be more humble and to know Christ better.",What's one thing that you hope to study in the future at CAPA?,"I think God willing, Ph.D. Yeah, Ph.D. It's easier doing it here because the church is here, the family is here, so it's easier studying here than going abroad.",Is there one specific topic that you'd like to study?,"Well, I think, just looking at people that are also servants of God...by the way they explain the Scriptures and their understanding of the Scriptures, just having the grace of having the in-depth understanding of Scriptures – this is one of the areas that I would really love to be exposed more.",What's one book that has influenced you a lot?,"I think one of the books that has really, well, helped me a lot, is a book of the Old Testament: <em>The Word and the World</em> [by Merrill, Rooker, and Grisanti]. Yeah, it's one of the books that's really helped me just to understand God dealing with His people and what He expects of us today.",What are your future plans for ministry?,"Well, my future plans is to develop more leaders and plant more churches. This nation is not yet evangelized, you know there are still a lot of people – 13% of the population is Muslim, and most of the people don't go to church, most of the people just nominal Christians but they don't have faith in Christ. So my desire is to evangelize more, to plant more churches, as well as develop more leaders.",What are some challenges in Malawi living as a Christian?,"Poverty. I'd say the greatest challenge is poverty. You have a people that are willing to go forth, preach the gospel. Like now, we have planted churches. The challenge is to maintain those churches, and basically it's because of how to support the pastors – you know, so that they can be able to put food on their tables, send their kids to school, so that they can stand boldly to proclaim the gospel of Christ, so this is the major problem.","If you could offer a word of encouragement to all the Christians in Malawi, what would you say to them?","Love Christ, obey His word, and He will be true to His Word.",,
Patrick Tsiga,What is your hometown like? How is it different from Lilongwe?,"My hometown is Salima. This is the central part of the central region of Malawi and the difference between Salima and Lilongwe…we are based in Lilongwe, that’s where I’m pastoring but my hometown is Salima and the difference is that Salima is a lakeshore district. But Lilongwe is just a city where there’s too many activities. Sure, sure. That’s it.<br><br><strong>So what is it like there in your hometown?</strong><br>Uh, it’s too hot. It’s too hot with a lot of fish. And a lot of freshwater body and… Wow! If I compare Lilongwe and Salima, these two places are different. Sure, sure.",What do you like to do during your free time?,"In my free time, I like hanging out with my family because as a pastor, always I’m on the call to minister to the flock of God. But, in my free time, I like going out with my family. Just relaxing somewhere, watching soccer. I love soccer. And reading. Yeah, Christian magazines and Christian books. Sure.<br><br><strong>Did you play soccer a lot when you were younger?</strong><br>Yeah, but not really. Not really. I used to play hockey. Yes, but soccer, yes, but I love soccer. But I was not a good footballer. Yeah, but I used to play hockey and some other games like chess and the like. Sure.<br><br><strong>INTERVIEWER: Are you teaching your kids to how to be great soccer players in the future?</strong><br>I only have two girls, and my girls they--yeah, they also like soccer because they follow what I like sometimes. Yeah, sure.",What is your favorite memory at CAPA?,"My favorite memory at CAPA is that when I came here, I did not know what good exegesis is all about. I didn’t, but when I came to CAPA and I started learning how to exegete a passage and how to focus on the word of God and how to preach God’s message… oh, wow! Those are my favorite memories. CAPA has brought a lot of eye-opening things to me. Also, the books we get from CAPA. We appreciate all those that are supporting CAPA because one thing I know: when you give somebody knowledge, you have given something powerful to someone because knowledge is power. Sure.",Do you have a favorite textbook that you used at CAPA?,"Yes, we received some books by Ted [Tripp] and it’s how to shepherd a child’s heart, <em>Shepherding a Child’s Heart</em>. So that book and the books that we get from here, they are good, good books. Yes, that’s it.",What has been your favorite class at CAPA so far and why?,"My favorite class has been hermeneutics as well as homiletics, because it is in hermeneutics that we know how to diagram, how we do exegesis. And then in homiletics, that’s when now we do the expositions that we are learning because the emphasis here is to study God’s word and preach God’s word through expository preaching, yeah.<br><br><strong>Who was the teacher?</strong><br>My hermeneutics teacher is Pastor Jim [Ayres] and in homiletics we used to have Brian Biedebach.",What is one attribute of God that you have personally experienced this past year?,"One attribute that I have experienced, love. I have learned how God loves us and I also want to love others just the same way God loves us, sure.<br><br><strong>And was it through classes you learned that, or through reading the Word, or was it something in your life that revealed that?</strong><br>Several sources. We study the word of God and we know what love is, but then [also] as we interact — the staff, the professors interacting with us because CAPA is not just a matter of dishing out information, but even we learn from the professors’ lifestyles. How we relate with the professors, how we relate with others. So all of these, the environment, what we are learning from the classroom, and what we are practicing even as we interact. Again, those have been the sources of inspiration. This is how we are to love others; this is what it means to be a corporate body of Christ — of Jesus.",What wisdom from wise men has benefited your ministry?,"We learn from what they are saying and their experiences and how they are doing their ministry.<br><br>In family and marriage, where you have somebody who is sharing their experience — how long he has been in marriage and the things he has gone through. And even as you study through the books that they give you and you learn something because it’s not easy to be married. And especially having that view that these two people that are in marriage, they are not perfect people. We are all sinners saved by grace. So understanding your spouse, knowing how you can handle certain issues -- these are some of the things that maybe we sometimes overlook or sometimes neglect. <br><br>When you see the one who is sharing with you is not just sharing something that is head knowledge, but is sharing something that is experiential — what they have gone through after studying the Word of God and practicing the Word of God. So what they tell you… this man is telling the truth because he practices what he studies. Sure, yes.",How has CAPA influenced your family life?,"The way I used to be, even as a minister, you know sometimes maybe you could focus much on the ministry, forgetting your family because you just want to serve. But we are encouraged to have quality time with our families, especially our wives and children so that we should balance our things. And that’s one of the things that I have said, “This is how much I have gotten from CAPA!” Yes, yes.<br><br><strong>Is there one point from <em>Shepherding a Child’s Heart</em> by Ted Tripp that really stood out?</strong><br>Yes, especially chapter one where it is talking about the center of all behavior activities is the heart. Most of the times, a lot of parents will miss out this area because we just look at what the child is doing without knowing that all what the child is doing is coming from the heart. So, if you deal with that, then you are dealing with the behavior.<br><br>And this book has got good chapters. 19 chapters! [<em>laughs</em>] 19 chapters that are still fresh in my mind even as I’m talking now! 19 chapters that are tackling good and relevant issues. Though the focus was concerning American society, but because the Word of God is [global], so you find that almost most of the information from that book can be applicable even in our society because it’s dealing with the Word of God and the sinful heart. Sure.",In what ways has the Lord grown you this past year? What has he been teaching you?,"My preaching has changed. Before coming to CAPA, I could just speak a verse and blow it out of context. I’ll just talk whatever I think, whatever I thought the passage was saying. But after now studying the Word of God, after now doing exegesis and block diagramming and the like, I have come to realize, “Ah! I think I was doing a lot of injustice to the text.” But now I’m focusing much on the Word of God and I want to preach the Word of God and expound the Word of God and do a lot exegesis until I hit the crown of the text. Sure.",What are you looking forward to this year?,"You know, I’m doing M.Div and we have got languages like Greek and Hebrew. My heart is in doing exegesis in Greek text. At the same time, doing exegesis in Hebrew text. That’s my goal because that’s what I want to do. If I study the Word of God and understand the Word of God from the Greek text and from the Hebrew text, I know for sure I’ll be able to help others who are struggling because they don’t know, or they have got limited knowledge concerning the Word of God.",What challenges have you faced in ministry this past year?,"To balance out school and doing ministry, because we are studying at the same time we are pastoring churches and at the same time we have got families to look after. So you’re talking of three things — we are studying, we are pastoring, and at the same time we are family men. So to balance out these things sometimes is a challenge. But we sacrifice certain things simply because we want to achieve the goals that God has for us during this time that we are studying.","If you could leave a word of encouragement to your fellow Christians in Malawi, what would you say to them?","I would say that the body of Christ in Malawi needs a serious study of the Word of God because most of the times, a lot of Christians, they don’t know how to study the Bible. But we thank God because I think that is the reason why God brought us here so that we can study and we can teach others. So my word of encouragement is that: keep on studying! And as we study together we will see the Word of God, God glorifying Himself through His Word.",,,,
